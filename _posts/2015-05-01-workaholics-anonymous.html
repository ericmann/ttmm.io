excerpt: How do you define your happiness? How diverse is that definition? Who controls
  it?
---
<p>I admit, I'm a bit of a workaholic.</p>
<p>I find something I enjoy and, like a dog with a bone, I don't let go. I hack on code late into the night. I wake up early (ok, I don't really go to sleep) and start hacking again before breakfast. I invest extra effort in making sure the project I'm working on is both stunning and built to a high standard of quality.</p>
<p>And I get paid to do it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the way I work isn't necessarily healthy. I frequently spend more hours in a day "working" than I actually log as work hours.[ref]Sometimes, when I'm stuck on a particularly difficult problem I take a walk to the park to help internalize and digest the issue. This is refreshing for me as it gives me a change of scenery and some fresh air. Usually, I return to my desk with some sort of a solution or at least an idea of the right track; it's just always felt odd to bill for "time walking to the park to clear my head."</p>
<p>I know. I'm doing it wrong.[/ref] As a result, while I often bill far more than my 40 hours for a week, I'm usually putting in even more time than that. It's great because I get things done. It's awful because I do so at considerable personal expense.</p>
<h2>The Cost of Failure</h2>
<p>Once, I was told "if you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life." I'm very proud that I've found a job where I get to do what I love every day. Unfortunately, tying my income to one of the things I love doing the most has some negative consequences.</p>
<p>When coding was a hobby, getting stuck on a problem was frustrating. I'd stay up all night chewing on a problem and, sometimes, realize that I was just completely incapable of solving it. I'd take a few days off the hobby project, shelve some code, and move on to something else.</p>
<p><em>If I failed at a hobby, I was able to shrug things off and move on.</em></p>
<p>When my hobby became my <em>job</em>, though, everything changed. I still work on similar problems. I still get stuck on issues that should be solvable. I still work late into the night trying to figure out issues.[ref]Working on a server configuration issue this past week led directly to my coding until 2am because I couldn't sleep until I fixed a bug. A good thing, this is not.[/ref] Sometimes, though thankfully it's rare, I come across a problem I'm completely incapable of solving.</p>
<p>But moving on - failing at the task - means I've spent hours of client/company billable work on a project/problem/product that won't ship or <em>will</em> eventually ship but at a much higher cost than expected. I can't just lick my wounds and move on.</p>
<p><em>If I fail in my job, I've failed my team</em>.</p>
<p>The idea of letting someone down is my own personal hell. It's the one thing that can, in an instant, take the best moment of a day and turn it into the worst of my life. Unfortunately, the risk of experiencing this moment is the one I shoulder by turning my <em>hobby</em> into my <em>job</em>.</p>
<h2>Find Your Happy</h2>
<p>Coding makes me happy. Solving problems makes me happy. Building things that impress and inspire makes me happy. But I can't limit my happiness to that <em>one</em> <em>thing</em>. The source of my happiness in life can't just be the work I do in my job.</p>
<p>I admit I spend far too many hours at a computer writing code; I do this because the code I write makes me happy. But it can't be the only thing, otherwise the code that fails, falls flat, or simply doesn't pan out to a shippable project continues to eat at my life and suck more joy out of my existence.</p>
<p>I'm working daily to rediscover the other parts of my life that bring me happiness and working to define my mood, self worth, and identity by <i>them</i> rather than just my job. This includes family, friends, the outdoors, other hobbies, and the like. They're just as important to my long-term well-being as my job - perhaps even more so.</p>
<p>How do you define your happiness? How diverse is that definition? Who controls it?</p>
