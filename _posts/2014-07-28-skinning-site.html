<p>When I bought my house, the first to-do item I was assigned was painting the bathroom.</p>
<p>As of this month, I've lived here a year, and we <em>finally</em> got the bathroom painted this weekend. It took us this long because we were a bit undecided on the paint color. After we <em>thought</em> we'd decided, weekends slipped away and our chance to get things done disappeared. By the time a free weekend presented itself, our opinions of the color changed once again.</p>
<p>Too light. Too dark. Not the right hue. Doesn't match the other features of the room. Different reasons helped us procrastinate for quite some time.</p>
<p>Until yesterday when we finally said "enough," picked a color, and carved time out of our day to finish the room once and for all.</p>
<p>It might not be the perfect shade, but it's different. It also demonstrates that we <em>can</em> get the project done. That changing the color of a room is a task that <em>doesn't</em> warrant a year of indecision. That we can now move on to other, more important parts of the house.</p>
<p>I've often heard WordPress themes referred to as the paint job that skins a site. Some site owners change their themes so frequently it's hard to know what to expect each time you come back.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I thought the visual identity of a site was so important that I held back changing my theme entirely. As a matter of fact, this site has only had 5 designs in the 7 years it's been online!</p>
<p>But I realize now just how much a new "paint job" can liven up an old space and bring new life to the lifeless. A blog, like this one, is more about the brand affixed to a body of knowledge conveyed through writing. My brand is more than the visual identity of this blog, and it's time I embraced that with a change.</p>
<p>I've been using the Sixteen Nine theme by StudioPress for just shy of a year, and I love it! But is it the best way to convey my content? Is it interactive enough that readers can have engaging experiences?</p>
<p>What more can I do, through design, to help my message reach the world? I'd like to find out, and I plan to experiment <em>heavily</em> in the coming months.</p>
