<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Several years ago, I spent the majority of my time freelancing while looking for regular work. Usually this paid well. Occasionally a client would take my work and skip the bill. It happened once with an architecture website. Again with a college seminar tracking site.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One customer, those, admitted he couldn't pay me in cash and offered instead to pay his debt in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>. I was fascinated with cryptocurrency, but had never owned any, so this seemed fair. I created a wallet, he transferred the crypto, and we went our separate ways.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The bill was tiny - around $100 - so I didn't keep track of anything at the time and long ago lost track of that wallet. It was more a novelty than anything else. Until recently when I discovered Bitcoin was now valued over $10k <em>each</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That would've put that long-forgotten wallet at well over a million dollars in today's value. I've spent weeks trying to track it down - scouring every hard disk, USB drive, and dusty old machine I can find.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's not there.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Plan B</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In a fit of frustration when I realized this wallet was nowhere to be found, I started dipping my toe into the world of mining. I have a handful of computers, some with relatively high-end GPUs; surely I could put them to work in my off hours earning a bit of revenue here and there.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My first experiment ran my desktop for a full day, the GPU maxed out at 85 degrees Celsius[ref]That's 185 degrees Fahrenheit for those of us not used to Celsius measurements.[/ref]. In all I earned about fifteen cents.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm sure I spent far more in terms of power and wear on my machine that I earned. I had also mined as part of a pool that held a $75 minimum payout. It would be ages before I'd ever see a cent from mining.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Surely there must be a better way.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Plan C</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you can't find the coin, mine it. If you can't mine the coin, <em>buy</em> it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I found a handful of broker websites where folks had similar stories to mine. They'd created a wallet once, invested what was a relatively small amount at the time, then forgot about Bitcoin entirely.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020 and their initial investment has ballooned by several orders of magnitude. Except their wallet is protected by a decade-old password they can't remember. Their options:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>Forget the whole thing</li>
<li>Spend additional time and money <em>maybe</em> cracking their old password</li>
<li>Convincing a random stranger to buy their old wallet and spend <em>their own</em> time and money <em>maybe</em> cracking their old password</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are a handful of marketplaces catering to the third option. You post your old wallet for sale and upload it to a Bitcoin-powered escrow site. A random stranger (read: me) comes by, pays for the wallet, and you get at least <em>some</em> recompense for your forgotten coin. Then the same stranger can spin up <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/">Hashcat</a> or similar and try to crack the password on the wallet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At worst, they've spent a couple hundred dollars on the wallet and even more on infrastructure as a hobby. At best, they make their way in and win the crypto lottery.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm hoping for the <em>latter</em> to occur and spending some time documenting my very own journey as the "random stranger" who bought a crypto wallet online in the hopes of striking gold.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the next piece in this series I'll talk more about the crypto wallet itself, how it's protected, and how I hope to start with password cracking.</p>
