<p>We did it!</p>
<p>In December, I asked the WordPress community to <a title="Crowdfunding a New Year’s Goal" href="http://eamann.com/journal/crowdfunding-new-years-goal/">help me crowdfund</a> a new[ref]Well, I made an attempt at a podcast early in 2013, but a lack of support meant it never got off the ground.[/ref] video podcast.  In just less than a week, the community came through and <a title="Things that Matter Most Campaign" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/things-that-matter-most-podcast">provided enough funding</a> to kick the thing off!</p>
<p>As of today, the Things that Matter Most website is officially <a title="Things that Matter Most" href="http://ttmm.io">LIVE</a>.</p>
<p>I've set up a publishing schedule that will push out a new video every Friday at 9am Pacific.  Episodes will be roughly 20 minutes in length and, for the time being, include just me as a speaker.  <em>However</em>, I do have a couple of guest hosts lined up throughout the year to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>I'm also taking the time to aggregate all of my WordCamp and other conference talk videos on the site.  If there's ever something I've spoken about - and someone has it on video - I want to put it in the same spot.</p>
<p>Today marks a new year and the kickoff of a new set of goals.  Will you make <a title="Things that Matter Most" href="http://ttmm.io">watching the show</a> a 2014 resolution?</p>
