<p>Many people have asked me why branding is important. In a previous post, I said branding was a means of simplifying communication. Coca-cola is distinguished from other colas by its unique taste. Rather than describing for a waiter what kind of cola you want with your meal, you ask for a Coke. This is a brand.</p>
<p>Brands are important because they eliminate confusion. A brand is also the promise of quality, whether in product satisfaction or the experience enjoyed. The vast elements of a brand make it difficult to imitate, allowing us to trust messages delivered through the brandâ€™s channel.</p>
<p>The process of branding forces you to prove your brand. It forces quality controls in production and a certain level of consistency in advertising. Branding is important because it turns a commodity into a unique, recognizable product. Furthermore, it enables the growth of a relationship between the company represented by the brand and its customer.</p>
<p>If I were to tell you that your company could no longer brand its products, how much would it affect your business?</p>
