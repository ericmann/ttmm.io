<p>In the human world, organic is better.  In the business world, synthetic is better.  Why?  There are several reasons, so let me give you a high-level overview.</p>
<h3>Organic</h3>
<p>Eating serves an organic system - us.  We are organic (well, <em>most</em> of us are...) so it is better to use organic things to sustain ourselves.  Sure, "traditional" growing practices yield larger harvests at lower production costs.  It even saves us a few dollars more at the grocery store.  The question remains, though, is it good for us?</p>
<p>Hundreds of people argue that organic food (grown without hormones, pesticides, or the use of cloning) is healthier.  This is an argument that remains to be proven.  The one thing I do know is that naturally grown food seems to taste better - this is just my opinion, and I accept that it may be slightly colored by the advertising efforts of organic farmers and advocates ...</p>
<h3>Synthetic</h3>
<p>Business, however, is entirely synthetic; it's a man-made construct that would cease to exist is we disappeared from the planet.  I'll admit that many businesses have developed over time - evolved, if you will.  This would seem an organic process, but keep in mind that man is still at the helm of business development.  There would be no new products, or <em>any</em> products for that matter, without someone designing them, marketing them, selling them, and buying them.</p>
<p>So what's the point?  Why does this matter?  Simple ... under which category should we place branding?</p>
<p>On the one hand, a brand is consumed - much like food.  An organically grown brand will be more palatable to some market segments because it feels 'natural.'  On the other hand, branding is a people-intensive activity.  Where in our dichotomy does it fall, then?</p>
<p>I'll give my answer and analysis on Friday.  Please share your analysis with me before then.</p>
