<p>At a sales training seminar a couple weeks ago, the presenter spoke on the topic of separating <strong>pay time</strong> from <strong>no pay time</strong>.  I was very familiar with this concept, but not in quite the way he put it.  All of us recognize the importance of tracking billable versus non-billable hours, but "pay time" doesn't necessarily mean billable hours.</p>
<p>Think of it this way.  A billable hour is an hour of your time for which you can directly bill a client.  At the same time, some of your client work might translate to non-billable hours.  Think of proposal creation and new client meetings.  Most consultants provide this time as a free service.</p>
<p><strong>Pay time</strong> is a different concept all together.  If you double the amount of <strong>pay time</strong> involved in your job, you double the amount of pay coming in the door.  On the same note, if you double your <strong>no pay time</strong>, your wallet doesn't seem any heavier.</p>
<p>If you were to double the amount of time you spend in new client meetings, you will increase your bottom line (more new business meetings = more new business in most industries).  But many of us ignore this simple fact so we can focus on optimizing our billable time.  When you think of these non-billable hours as <strong>pay time</strong>, though, it changes the dynamic drastically.</p>
<p>How many hours do you commit to each week?  How many are billable?  How much of that is <strong>pay time</strong>?  Is your focus in the right place?</p>
