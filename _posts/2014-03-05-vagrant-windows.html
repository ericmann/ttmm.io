<p>I often brag about the fact that I've dumped heavy tools like XAMPP in favor of Vagrant.  I'm quite proud of this accomplishment, and I urge every other developer I meet to look into Vagrant.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, setting up Vagrant proves to be a bit trickier on Windows.  I admit, I struggled a bit with it myself when I first set things up.</p>
<p>A few days ago, though, I decided to swap out my aging Windows machine for a new one - so I have the opportunity to set up Vagrant again, from scratch, on Windows.</p>
<p>Let me walk you through it.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>I set up a handful of things on every Windows development box I used.  For the purposes of Vagrant, though, there are two tools in particular you'll want handy.</p>
<p>First, <a title="Git Downloads" href="http://git-scm.com/download">download and install Git</a>.  You'll want to download the real command-line tool itself, not a custom GUI.  When you install, you have the option to add Git and its Linux-style command line tools to your system Path.  Do this!</p>
<p>If you already have Git installed, or you forgot to select this option upon installation, you'll need to add Git's [cci]/bin[/cci] directory to your Path manually.  I've already <a title="Linux-flavored Windows" href="https://ttmm.io/tech/linux-flavored-windows/">written instructions</a> for how to do just that.</p>
<p><a href="http://eamann.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-04-17.21.50.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6124" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-04-17.21.50-216x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2014-03-04 17.21.50" width="216" height="300" /></a>Second, you'll want to set up an elevated command prompt shortcut - this isn't a prerequisite for installing Vagrant, just a handy tool to have around.</p>
<p>I usually set up a custom shortcut in [cci]C:/Tools[/cci] that launches an elevated command prompt.  I also configure it to use [cci]CMD + ALT + HOME[/cci] as a shortcut key so I can launch a new elevated prompt whenever I need one.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The installation process is fairly straight-forward from this point: you'll have to download and install 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="VirtualBox" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> (4.3.8 at the time of this writing)</li>
<li><a title="Vagrant" href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant</a> (1.4.3 at the time of this writing)</li>
</ol>
<p>There's nothing fancy to it, just install both and then move on with the process.</p>
<h2>Configuring Your Environment</h2>
<p>I use <a title="Varying Vagrant Vagrants" href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a> (VVV) as a project template for my local environment.  If you're using the same this will help - if not, skip to the next section.</p>
<p>Use Git to clone VVV to wherever you want your projects to live on your hard drive (I keep mine in [cci]C:\Projects[/cci]).  If you have existing projects to pull in to the environment, you can drop them in custom subdirectories of [cci]/vvv/www[/cci] and configure the Nginx rules for the sites.  I'll leave that exercise for later.[ref]If you're stuck, look at the default sites and configuration that ships with VVV and build your custom site configs off that.[/ref]</p>
<p>The next step is to turn things on.  Launch your elevated command prompt[ref]An elevated prompt isn't strictly necessary here.  But I usually spin things up and then use the same prompt to run tools like Node and Grunt while developing.  Using a single prompt for all is just faster.[/ref] and run [cci]vagrant up[/cci].</p>
<p>Voila!  You have a local environment!</p>
<h2>Working With Vagrant</h2>
<p>The biggest reason we installed Git (and set it in our Path) in the beginning was to grant access to a *nix SSH tool.  You can now log in to your vagrant box with a simple [cci]vagrant ssh[/cci].  Without this tool, you'd need to download, install, and configure a tool like puTTY to access the system.</p>
<p>I like simplicity; [cci]vagrant ssh[/cci] from an existing prompt is easier.</p>
<p>You'll also likely want the ability to work with your MySql databases from something other than the command line.  Personally, I use <a title="MySql Workbench" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/tools/workbench/">MySql Workbench</a>.[ref]It's conveniently free, open source, and built by the same people who build MySql in the first place.[/ref]  Once installed, it can connect to a database server over an SSH tunnel and run commands remotely.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6126" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-04-17.38.46.png" alt="Screenshot 2014-03-04 17.38.46" width="900" height="500" /></p>
<p>If you're using VVV, then your SSH username is "vagrant," your SSH keyfile is stored in [cci]C:\Users&#123;your name}&#46;vagrant.d\insecure_private_key[/cci], your MySql username is "root," and your MySql password is "root."  Set up all of the above and you'll have a solid connection to your database from something <em>other</em> than the command line.</p>
<h2>What's Left?</h2>
<p>Vagrant is just one tool I use to make local development easier on Windows.  Luckily for me, it also makes web development easy on Mac, too.</p>
<p>With the exception of the elevated command prompt above, all of the software I've listed in this article are cross-platform.  I use the <em>exact same tools on my Mac that I use on my PC</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, I also have a standardized IDE, test suite, and command-line helper tools that make writing code easier, faster, and less error-prone.</p>
<p>What tools would you add to the above to help new developers get started, regardless of platform?</p>
