excerpt: Just because a handful of CEOs use their $1 salary as a gimmick doesn't mean
  it's a target to shoot for.

<p>When I was in high school, a guidance counselor tried to give me a breakdown of the salaries various types of people could expect to earn. A high school dropout would be lucky to earn $18k a year. A high school graduate would be able to make $20-25k. A college degree would bump you farther to $30-35.</p>
<p>Before I began my career, this was the <em>only</em> advice I'd ever gotten about salary expectations. Ironically, every potential employer since then has asked me for my salary requirements during the interview process. Not knowing what to actually expect, I once took a job that only paid $25k because I believed the company president when he told me that was what I was worth.</p>
<p>This set the tone for much of my career. I did what I could to earn an extra 5% here or 10% there, advancing from junior to senior positions and chasing after a loftier position with increased responsibilities. I've always wanted to follow an upwards-pointing career trajectory, and that covers <em>both</em> what I do and how I'm compensated.</p>
<p>One day, I'd like to have a C-level position. But the current trend for C-level executives to take salaries of just $1 is disheartening.</p>
<h2>Achievement</h2>
<p>Often, compensation in a position is equated with the achievement that position represents. You get a promotion <em>and</em> a raise, not a promotion and a pay-cut. We look at CEOs with so-called "golden parachutes" with disdain, but really, they've earned their new income through the positions they've held and the jobs they've performed.</p>
<p>I've worked my ass off to get where I am today, and I would challenge anyone who alleges that I'm earning more than I deserve in my position.</p>
<p><a title="15 top executives with $1 salaries" href="http://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/2014/09/15/executives-one-dollar-salaries/index.html">Seeing CEOs herald their $1 salary</a> makes me question what they've achieved in their lofty positions. On the one hand, it's inspiring to see someone make such a sacrifice (forgoing a million-dollar salary) for the sake of their company. On the other hand, for someone leading large enterprises, to take such a ridiculous salary requires you to be independently wealthy in the first place.</p>
<p>I have trouble respecting a multi-million dollar company headed by a CEO who takes next to no salary staffed by hard-working men and women earning far less than the CEO is forgoing in the first place.</p>
<p>I work hard to do what I do, and I have an objective to one day hold a higher position with more leadership potential. I hope that comes with more than a $1 salary, though, because I definitely think anyone who's worked hard enough to earn a salary that reflects their effort and responsibility.</p>
<p>Frankly, the $1 salary club is a gimmick; one for which I hold absolutely zero respect.</p>
