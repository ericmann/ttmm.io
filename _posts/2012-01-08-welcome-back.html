<p>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to be shadowed in my day job by a computer science student.</p>
<p>He was interested in web development and eCommerce, so I thought I'd show off a few of my sites.  He was pretty impressed.</p>
<p>Well, until we got to <em>this</em> site.</p>
<p>The old Jumping Duck Media website was somewhat stale.  WordPress plugin listings were out of date.  The news feed was over a year old.  And the online store was just broken.</p>
<p>So I blushed, apologized, and quickly moved on to another, more up-to-date site.</p>
<p>When I got home, I immediately pulled this site down and committed to rebuilding from the ground-up.  I'm proud to say that I'm (mostly) done rebuilding and ready for the public to once again see what I'm up to.</p>
<h2>The Objective of This Site</h2>
<p>My goal has always been to help people overcome their fear of launching a dream.  I provide direct support through consulting, help pull together resources and other material, and (when I'm able) I've been known to contribute financially as well.</p>
<p>That goal is the foremost purpose of this site.</p>
<p>I will provide code tutorials for developers.  Support forums for those still learning.  A <strong>free monthly newsletter</strong> with lessons and resources.  New product purchases and downloads.</p>
<p>Stick around and see what comes next.</p>
<h2>Still to Come</h2>
<p>I'm in the process of changing my online business model.  Simply building WordPress plugins, giving them away, and sitting on IRC and in support forums isn't a sustainable endeavor.  So some things will be changing - and some things will stay the same.</p>
<p>I will <strong>continue</strong> to develop cleanly-coded open source plugins.</p>
<p>I will <strong>continue</strong> to distribute these plugins for free online.</p>
<p>I will<strong> begin</strong> to develop and distribute free, open source WordPress themes.</p>
<p>I will <strong><em>no longer</em></strong> offer free support for these products.</p>
<p>Limiting support is more a reflection on my limited time than anything else.  I can't afford to spend hours debugging personal sites, re-configuring Linux installations, or offering custom workarounds for conflicts with other, incompatible systems.  Particularly when other people have been benefiting financially from my free efforts.</p>
<p>So instead, I will be launching a paid support forum on this site.</p>
<p>Membership will be only $5 per month, and you'll get support for all of my plugins <em>as well as</em> WordPress itself from one location.</p>
<p>As I get ready to release new themes and plugins, you'll also have exclusive access to early releases, <em>private</em> beta tests, and perhaps a handful of non-distributed systems as well.</p>
