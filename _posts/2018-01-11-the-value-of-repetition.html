excerpt: Repetition is the key to memorizing and becoming an expert in almost anything.

<p>I took martial arts classes in college. They were a blast! Well, until the instructor decided I was his favorite demonstration tool and kept throwing me around the room to teach the class how to arrest falls.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Other than that, it was an exciting few terms of energetic classes and faux sparring with friends. One of the most memorable parts of the courses, though, were the <em>forms</em>﻿ we had to memorize.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>These were patterns of moves that are used to judge skill and the level of expertise of the participant. Had I continued my studies past two terms of courses, I&#x27;m sure I would have learned many different forms as I progressed through the ranks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Each form is a set pattern and is, at least among the lower levels, easy to memorize and repeat. For quite a while, practicing my forms became a daily routine. I&#x27;d repeat the same moves over and over again, turning them from a conscious effort at reproducing the pattern into subconscious muscle memory.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Repetition</em>﻿ is the key to memorizing forms. It&#x27;s the key to memorizing most anything, really.</p>

<h2>Code Katas</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:core/heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Several developers have started cultivating a practice of completing daily or weekly <a href="http://codekata.com/">code katas</a>. These are specific challenges meant to test some of the more rudimentary skills developers need to hone to be good at their jobs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that specific code katas are <em>simple</em>﻿. Many are difficult and very challenging, but every one of them exercises the parts of our brains that solve coding problems on a daily basis. Practicing code katas regularly has the same effect on a developer as practicing forms does on a martial artist.</p>

<h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:core/heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Whenever I see a coding interview, it usually involves a developer struggling to remember the correct boilerplate to bootstrap a project. Or searching for the correct argument order for a method in the language&#x27;s standard library. Or re-deriving a common algorithm. Or ... the list goes on.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>But <em>practicing</em>﻿ these skills helps to perfect them. It gives you the ability to, from memory, bootstrap a method or an algorithm or design an interface. You&#x27;ve done this before, it&#x27;s easier to do it again. It&#x27;s easier still because you don&#x27;t have to think, you can just <em>do</em>﻿.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Practicing also helps you to learn and improve. Developers don&#x27;t often have time available to refactor production code. But there&#x27;s nothing that says you can&#x27;t spend a few minutes each day practicing and rewriting a small component just for the sake of learning. You might even stumble upon an extra optimization that will make a difference in production.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Or you might just learn a new pattern that will save time and energy the <em>next</em>﻿ time you build a similar system.</p>
