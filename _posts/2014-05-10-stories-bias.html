<p>I love stories.</p>
<p>Reading stories, writing stories, telling stories. They're a way to recount history and, through fiction, a way to make persuasive points about one thing or another. I've always been a fan of storytelling, and many of my friends indulge me when I get together.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I was able to meet with some friends I hadn't seen in a while. They asked me about my recent travels, and I recounted some of the more enlightening parts of my trip to Brazil - namely arriving in a non-English-speaking airport with no idea how to get to a hotel and no way to communicate my needs.</p>
<p>"Wow, that sounds pretty terrifying. I don't think I could ever do something like that."</p>
<p>"Of course you could! You've been plenty of places, and I'm sure you'd be more than OK working your way through."</p>
<p>"Well, imagine if you had faced that as a woman. Alone. It probably wouldn't have been as much fun."</p>
<p>I admit, I hadn't thought of it that way at the time.</p>
<h2>Check your Bias</h2>
<p>I will only ever see the world through one set of eyes and one set of experiences. That doesn't devalue who I am at all, but it <em>increases</em> the value of listening to the stories of those around me and trying to put myself (figuratively) in their shoes.</p>
<p>When I have to navigate a foreign country with no means of communication other than pantomime and prayer, I will only ever do so as a white man. It's impossible for me to experience that any other way, so while I can <em>imagine</em> other circumstances, I will always need to yield to others for factual accounts.</p>
<p>When I tell a story in person, my personal bias - the demographic lens through which I experience the world - is immediately apparent. I can't pretend to be anyone I'm not when I'm speaking, so everyone can immediately identify my bias and raise concerns like the one above.</p>
<p>When I write, though, that bias is a bit more hidden. I can write under a pseudonym. I can publish through an anonymous medium with a phony biography in place. I have the option of obscuring my background so no one can claim such bias.</p>
<h2>Bias and Written Stories</h2>
<p>I read several travel blogs before my Brazil trip to mentally set up expectations before I landed. Some were collaborative - written by groups who had gone to the country for hiking, exploring, or business purposes. A few were solo accounts, ironically similar to my own of trying to navigate the country with zero Portuguese skills.</p>
<p>The even larger irony is that more than half of these solo accounts were written by women. Like me, they landed in a foreign airport with no clue how to get to their destination and made it safely through depending on the kindness (and ability to understand pantomime) of taxi drivers.</p>
<p>When I read these accounts, I related instantly to the stories. I didn't discover until <em>later</em> they'd been written by women and I was pleasantly surprised our experiences were so similar despite our difference in gender.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the common complaints I see of men writing women, or of white authors writing minorities. Too often we look at the demographic of the <em>writer</em> and immediately assume they're incapable of relating to or conveying the stories of another demographic.</p>
<p>I was recounting a personal experience, and it was implied that my experience would not apply to another demographic - despite my finding very similar stories presented by that very demographic. I find it a bit frustrating to have my stories limited in their application to demographics fitting my personal appearance.</p>
<p>To this end, I proposed a wild idea:</p>

<p>I still hold that a somewhat anonymous anthology would be an interesting experiment. Do <em>you</em> see any value there?</p>
