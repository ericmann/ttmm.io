excerpt: A "virtual private network" is a way to keep your data secure, whether your
  on a dedicated 4G tether or connected to Starbuck's free wireless.  Traffic from
  your machine is encrypted at the machine, sent to a remote (trusted) server, decrypted,
  and proxied to the real network target.

<p>Earlier this year, I demonstrated to a colleague just how easy it was to sniff data out of the air when everyone's connected to a public network.</p>
<p>We were sitting in the Chandler Library at <a title="WordCamp Phoenix" href="http://2014.phoenix.wordcamp.org">WordCamp Phoenix</a>, and he had been watching me <a title="Web Requests and Data Leakage" href="http://eamann.com/tech/data-leakage/">write an article</a> about network security.  He challenged me to snoop on his machine, so I pulled up a network profiling tool and started rattling off the names of every application on his Mac that were talking to the network.</p>
<p>He, understandably, freaked out and shut off his machine.</p>
<h2>How Secure Are You?</h2>
<p>I was clearing out my laptop's list of trusted networks the other day when I discovered some troubling entries there.  Once upon a time, I was forced to work from a Starbucks and their generic "attwifi" network was added to my whitelist of networks to which the machine will "automatically connect."</p>
<p>Not very secure.</p>
<p>I do travel a lot, though, and I have several hotels and airports permanently loaded in my machine's list of trusted connections.  Since I'm traveling this weekend - to a country known to have hacking and data security issues - I wanted to be sure my data was safe.</p>
<p>So I configured a VPN.</p>
<h2>Private Networking</h2>
<p>A "virtual private network" is a way to keep your data secure, whether your on a dedicated 4G tether or connected to Starbuck's free wireless.  Traffic from your machine is encrypted <em>at the machine</em>, sent to a remote (trusted) server, decrypted, and proxied to the real network target.</p>
<p>It's similar to how a man-in-the-middle attack might work - except I happen to trust the guy in the middle sniffing my traffic, and I can completely secure my communications with him.  He, in turn, forwards my web requests (and server responses) on to their destination.</p>
<p>I can browse any site on any network with a high level of confidence that my information is secure.</p>
<h2>Potential Setups</h2>
<p>One setup, which I hope to investigate soon, is to set up a dedicated server in my home network and open an encrypted ssh tunnel from my remote location to my home.  The advantages here are manifold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic from my machine will <em>always</em> come from my home office's IP address</li>
<li>The only person I need to trust with my information is, well, myself</li>
<li>Once tunneled in to my home network, I'll have access to the same resources (printers, NAS, etc) that I do at home</li>
</ul>
<p>An open-source tool called <a title="sshuttle" href="https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle">sshuttle</a> will make this possible with relative ease.</p>
<p>The setup I'm currently using is a contract with <a title="Private Internet Access" href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>.  A one-year contract costs less than running my VPS for the year. It also comes with a level of anonymity that ssh-ing to my local network would not provide. I can flip a switch and route my traffic through data centers on the East coast, the West coast, Europe ...</p>
<p>I don't have the benefit of accessing my home network's resources remotely, but I do now have the ability to visit sites and conduct business with relative anonymity.</p>
<p>I value anonymity almost as much as I value security. Not having to maintain my own hardware is an added bonus.</p>
