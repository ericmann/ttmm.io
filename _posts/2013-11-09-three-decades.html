excerpt: Today is my birthday, and also marks the completion date for my previous
  "to do before I reach a certain birthday" list. I'm asking for your help in building
  my list for the next however many years.

<p>I've never been a fan of bucket lists.  Instead, I just keep track of a list of goals and do my best to complete them.  More of an on-going to-do list than anything else.</p>
<p>Today, I'm proud to announce that I've <em>mostly</em> finished my current list.  Considering today is also my birthday, this is a pretty snazzy announcement.  The only things really remaining on my list were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire a concealed carry license - something I still plan to do, sooner rather than later</li>
<li>Go hunting and actually catch something - making plans for 2014 right now</li>
</ul>
<p>My question to you, dear readers, is what should I put on my list <em>next</em>?  To give you an idea of the scope I plan for, here are some of my accomplishments from my previous lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a house - check</li>
<li>Get married - check</li>
<li>Speak at 5 conferences in 1 year - check</li>
<li>Run a marathon - check times 3</li>
<li>Speak internationally - check</li>
</ul>
<p>My latest list was pretty aggressive, but as a "all the things I want to accomplish before I turn 30" I think that was a good idea.  What next?</p>
