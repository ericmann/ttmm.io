<blockquote>Today’s primary goal is to help you grow in healthy, active church involvement. So:</p>
<p>1) If you are not yet plugged into a church, choose a church to attend over the upcoming weekend, and plan to go.</p>
<p>2) If you are already a member of a church or attend one church consistently, choose one other church event in the near future (Bible study, serving event, church picnic, etc.) to attend. If you brought home a bulletin or calendar from the previous weekend, it may come in handy! Otherwise, call your church or visit their website, and find out what is going on.</p>
<p>Either way, once you choose an event, commit to attend, whether that involves registering online, calling the church or responding to a Facebook event page. This accountability will help you follow through.</p>
<p>Finally, share your thoughts and experiences in your Facebook Note.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm also attending two weekly Bible study groups - one with my church and one hosted by a friend of mine who goes to a church across town.  It's nice to connect with members of another congregation from time to time; we can compare notes on sermon series and help build one another up.</p>
<p>This past weekend my church teamed up to perform yard work for a member of the community.  It's part of an ongoing "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1976402414695.2103907.1382154991">Acts of Service</a>" effort we've been working on to get congregation members out and active with our local community.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say I'm fairly active with and connected to my church.  I invite non-church friends to events, I sponsor events, I prepare advertising, and I volunteer within the church to keep things running.  It can be a bit draining at times (a friend once remarked that I spent more time volunteering with the church than I did working at my job ... untrue, but that was his perception), but it's rewarding too.</p>
