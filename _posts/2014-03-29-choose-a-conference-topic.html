excerpt: I'm going to expose my three secret ways to come up with conference presentation
  ideas.
---
<p>I like speaking at conferences all over - local meetups, nearby WordCamps, and distant JavaScript conferences.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll submit one topic, sometimes I'll submit many - and people often ask me how I choose my topics.  I want to give away my secrets.</p>
<h2>What are you good at?</h2>
<p>I'm really good at a handful of things.  I'm passable at quite a few others.</p>
<p>When I approach a WordCamp or any other conference, I start with a list of things I'm capable of and want to share.  Often, this list looks a bit like the editorial schedule for my blog as well.</p>
<p>Picking what I want to talk about from this list is fairly easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll grab the topic about which I know the most but haven't spoken in a while</li>
<li>I'll pick the topic about which my colleagues have asked about recently</li>
<li>I'll flesh out a topic I've covered on my blog that's received a lot of comments</li>
</ul>
<p>If you make such a list, I can guarantee you'll be able to suss out at least one topic for your next conference proposal.</p>
<h2>What do you want to be known for?</h2>
<p>In the WordPress community, people know me as a hard-core backend coder.  That's fine, but I'm much more than that and don't like to be pigeon-holed by any certain definition.</p>
<p>I'm also a writer, so I'll speak about writing.</p>
<p>I invested quite a bit of time and money earning a degree in business.  I also happen to enjoy marketing.  So I'll speak about business and marketing.</p>
<p>How are you known in the community?  How do you <em>want</em> to be known?</p>
<h2>What do you want to learn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, I'll do something that terrifies me: I'll submit a talk proposal on a topic I know nothing about.  If I'm selected to speak, it forces me to double down and learn something new in order to put the talk together.</p>
<p>I hold myself to very high standards, and I will <em>never</em> give a half-hearted presentation.</p>
<p>I've given 40-minute talks that have taken 40+ hours to flesh out - not because I'm preparing material, but because I'm <em>learning</em> the material first and then teaching it.  Knowing I'll have to stand in front of my peers and make a presentation gives me the incentive to learn the topic inside and out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'd just dabble and likely learn nothing.</p>
<p>These are my three tricks for devising a talk proposal idea.  How do you pull your list of proposals together?</p>
