<p>About a month ago, a colleague silently added me as an administrator to a GitHub repository.  I took a look and saw a bunch of code and lingo without much explanation.</p>
<p>Scratching my head I decided to ignore it for a while and let him do his thing.</p>
<p>Then, a couple of weeks ago, another coworker was talking about code related to the project in the company chat room.  It happened to deal with a field I know and love, so I paid a bit more attention.</p>
<p>We talked about features, load balancing, threading, and remote API integrations - all things I love and enjoy.</p>
<p>The conversation had me super excited about this product my team was building - a project I now had a hand in developing - but I couldn't tell anyone about it yet.</p>
<p>The anticipation was excruciating!</p>
<h2>Enter PushUp</h2>
<p>https://twitter.com/10up/status/442058079597625344</p>
<p>We finally pushed our new product out the door yesterday afternoon.  If you missed the announcement, feel free to wander over to <a title="PushUp: Push Notifications for WordPress" href="http://10up.com/blog/pushup-push-notifications-wordpress/">our company blog</a> to catch up.  The video is totally worth it.</p>
<p>I'm super excited to announce that I'm <a title="Daily Dogfooding" href="http://eamann.com/tech/daily-dogfooding/">using 10up's newest product</a> on this site, too - if you're visiting on Safari you've already see the popup asking for permission to notify you.</p>
<p>Please say yes.</p>
<h2>Part of a Team</h2>
<p>Working remotely can be difficult.  You're isolated, don't spend much time talking to team members, and generally feel like you have to go it alone on projects.</p>
<p>At 10up, that's <em>not</em> the case.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>I work with a (growing) group of high-class, high-talent, <em>brilliant</em> developers and strategists.[ref]And did I mention, we're hiring!  If you have what it takes to be a contributor to a team of high-caliber developers, strategists, and all-around technologists, <a title="Get in Touch" href="http://eamann.com/get-in-touch/">drop me a line</a> and I'll make an introduction![/ref]  We work on amazing projects for clients and tackle every obstacle in our path as a group.  As of yesterday, we also work on and publish incredible products in the tech space.</p>
<p>A fact that excites me about the future of development <em>and</em> the future of 10up.</p>
<p>My team works on spectacular projects - and we never work on these projects in isolation.  I'm proud of what we've accomplished together and excited about what we'll do next.</p>
