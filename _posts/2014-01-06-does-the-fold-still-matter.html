excerpt: Does "the fold" still matter, or is this an outdated concept left over from
  the days of print media?  In many ways, the answer is "no" because the web is a
  very different place than print.  But in some ways, the answer is also a resounding
  "yes!"

<p>Old-school media types remember the importance of putting the most valuable hook in an article "above the fold."  Page real estate on the <em>top</em> of the newspaper was the most valuable because, frequently, it was the only trigger for readers to open a newspaper and keep investing.</p>
<p>On the web, however, this isn't quite as important because scrolling is easy and the barrier for readers to continue reading is much lower than with printed media.  Or is it?</p>
<h2>Valuable Real Estate</h2>
<p>Many web media types claim "<a title="The Fold is Dead" href="http://www.thinkdesigninteract.com/post/adapt-or-die-and-the-fold-is-dead/">the</a> <a title="The Fold is Dead" href="http://imagebox.com/blog/industry/the-fold-is-dead-2/">fold</a> <a title="The Fold is Dead" href="http://www.thinkbrownstone.com/blog/2011/11/22/the-fold-is-dead-long-live-the-fold/">is</a> <a title="The Fold is Dead" href="http://www.propellermediaworks.com/the-fold-is-dead-scroll-with-it/">dead</a>."  At the same time, anyone with experience selling advertising on their site knows that "above the fold" ads carry a premium over ads placed elsewhere.  I've seen quite a few sites that routinely sell out their top-of-page banners and top-of-sidebar block ads only to place "buy this space" placeholders deeper in the footer because no one wants to buy them.</p>
<p>So if the space at the top of the page is more valuable to advertisers, is the fold really dead?</p>
<p>If the fold is unimportant, why do so many shy away from buying (much cheaper) ads lower on the page?</p>
<h2>Attention Deficit</h2>
<p>If you're anything like me, you're a multi-tasker.  I run anywhere from 8 to 30 tabs in my browser at any given moment; not because I have so much to do, but because I'll see an interesting link in an article and ctrl+click to open it in a new tab so I can read it later.</p>
<p>Later might mean five minutes.</p>
<p>Later might mean five hours.</p>
<p>On some sites I read, the link I click often has only a parting relation to its actual content, and I'm left scratching my head later wondering where I found the link and why I clicked it in the first place.  Other times, I am faced with the site in the screenshot below:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5997" align="aligncenter" width="614"]<a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-receive-wordpress-emails-from-localhost/"><img class=" wp-image-5997  " alt="Screenshot of an article I clicked through based on a friend's post to Twitter." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/01/Screenshot-2014-01-02-07.35.27-1024x547.png" width="614" height="328" /></a> Screenshot of an article I clicked through based on a friend's post to Twitter.[/caption]</p>
<p>Site navigation is evident.  Advertising is evident.  If I hadn't clicked the link just a few minutes ago, I might guess (correctly) the article is about emails, WordPress, and localhost.  But honestly, that's not a catchy title.</p>
<p>If I come to this tab 5-minutes after clicking a contextual link in another article, I'd read it.</p>
<p>If I come to this tab at the end of the day, having clicked a link before I started work and wanting to catch up before I shut down, I'd probably click the little X at the top of the page instead.</p>
<p><em>There is nothing in this title to make a visitor scroll down without added context.</em></p>
<h2>The Fold Still Matters</h2>
<p>Whether you're selling advertising on your site, or catering to readers spreading their limited attention across a wide range of sites, <strong>the fold still matters</strong>.</p>
<p>As easy as it might be to scroll on an otherwise long document, it's also just as easy to close the page and <em>not</em> continue reading.  Make sure the content you have above the fold is compelling enough to keep the reader scrolling - because they likely have other demands on their attention and, if those demands are more compelling, will just close the article rather than keep reading.</p>
<p>Make your above-the-fold content <a title="8 Incredibly Simple Ways to Get More People to Read Your Content" href="http://www.copyblogger.com/scannable-content/">easy to consume</a> and compelling.  Then, you will get the reader to move beyond the fold.</p>
