    Fold is Dead</h2><p>Not too long ago, we read most of our news not online but
    in the newspaper.  The most important stories were all "above the fold" -  in
    the few inches of page real estate at the top-half of the page.  Where things
    were visible when the paper was folded in half and on display in the paper machine.</p><p>If
    you wanted to run an "above the fold" story it needed to be important, have a

    that sold the paper, so getting anything wrong in this space was a fatal sin.</p><p>Now
    that we're living in an Internet age and everything's consumed in a browser, this
    isn't the case much more.  Readers are quick to scroll down a few inches, so packing
    all of the important stuff above the invisible "fold" of the browser is an almost
    laughable objective.</p><p>Instead, we make pages extra long so we can focus on
    telling a story with as many words as are needed.  Many sites are now implementing
    a feature called infinite scroll so readers are never met with an abrupt "the
    end."  For most of us it's truly a better world.</p><h2>Long Live the Fold</h2><p>Sadly,
    the abundance of screen real estate has destroyed the art of storytelling.  When
    you tell a story, you're building a house.  One brick at a time.</p><p>You place
    the first brick - your first sentence or thought or paragraph.  If it stands,
    the reader continues on.</p><p>You place another brick - introduce another character
    or twist the plot slightly.  If it stands, the reader continues on.</p><p>Another
    brick.  Then another.  And another.  Every line in the story builds upon the next
    until the reader can't <em>not</em> keep reading.  They'll scroll indefinitely
    so long as the foundation is solid and the house keeps standing.  But they have
    to get past those few foundational elements first.</p><p>This is why the most
    important part of your website - your story - your copy - must lie above the fold.
     If the headline is not enticing, if the first few lines of story aren't deeply
    moving, if the reader has no reason to care ... no one will scroll <em>past</em>
    the invisible fold of the browser.</p><p>This is why sites that clutter the top
    section of their site with huge graphical banners, related posts links, recent
    comment boxes, or paid ads are so annoying to me.  They distract from the story,
    and are the number one reason I use <a title="Evernote Clearly" href="http://evernote.com/clearly/">Evernote's
    Clearly</a> in my browser.</p><p>In short, I'm redoubling my efforts to bring
    you a better experience.  If anyone needs to use Clearly or Safari's Reader on
