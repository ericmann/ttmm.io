    When the definition becomes tied to achieving that target, a noble pursuit becomes

excerpt: Often, we look forward at those ahead to help build a personal definition
  of greatness - and then we chase after that with all our might.  This is not a bad
  thing.  It is when our definition of greatness becomes tied to achieving that target
  - which is often a moving target - that our once noble pursuit becomes corrupt.

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Last Sunday, I had the opportunity to listen to </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" title="Gospel of Mark" href="http://www.ajesuschurch.org/teaching-current/?sermon_id=993">an amazing sermon on the Gospel of Mark</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.  Among other things, John Mark covered the part of the narrative where Jesus' disciples argued about who was the greatest.</span></p>
<p>The illustration extended to modern economics and business.  The fact that you and I are always looking at those <em>ahead</em> of us.  Those farther along in their careers.  Those with more money.  A faster car.  A bigger house.</p>
<p>We always look ahead; rarely (if ever) do we look back at those behind us.  When we do, the sentiment is usually along the lines of "thank goodness I'm not still <em>there</em>."  An equally damning concept to the covetous thoughts we hold towards those leading the charge.</p>
<h2>Greatness</h2>
<p>Often, we look forward at those ahead to help build a personal definition of greatness - and then we chase after that with all our might.  This is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>It is when our definition of greatness becomes tied to achieving that target - which is often a <em>moving</em> target - that our once noble pursuit becomes corrupt.</p>
<p>The part of the sermon that spoke the most to me, was Jesus' definition of greatness:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.”<br />
- <a title="Mark 9:35" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%209:35&amp;version=NIV">Mark 9:35</a></p></blockquote>
<p>True greatness isn't being the first to climb the mountain, it's being the one <i>helping</i> others make their way to the top.  More plainly, by helping others reach the top, their achievement becomes your success.</p>
<h2>Mt Adams</h2>
<p>Last year, I took a group of Boy Scouts hiking in the <a title="Mt Adams" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Adams_(Washington)">Mt. Adams wilderness</a>.  Our goal was to summit the mountain in a single day.[ref]About half of our group made it. However, they weren't able to make it back down before nightfall and had to bivouac in the woods.  That is a story for another day...[/ref]  Due to my work schedule, I had to meet the guys in the woods on Saturday morning; I woke up at 3am because I had to meet the Scouts before they left for the summit.</p>
<p>Our plan was to leave camp by 7am and summit by 3pm, returning to camp around 7:30.  It would be a long, arduous day, but reaching the summit would be amazing.</p>
<p>When I'm hiking with the Scouts, my job is to bring up the rear.  I hang back, not because I'm slower than everyone else, but so I can keep all of the Scouts in the same spot and catch any problems that crop up.  Encouraging teenagers who fall behind - particularly when I'm tired and cranky, too - is difficult.  On our past two climbing trips, though, I've managed to get every single Scout up the mountain.</p>
<p>Part way up the hill - just below <a title="South Climb to Lunch Counter" href="http://trailpedia.org/mt-adams-south-climb-to-lunch-counter/">lunch counter</a>[ref]I only made it to about 10,000 feet. Next time I hope to make it to the summit with better planning and preparation.[/ref] - I made the mistake of looking up.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_6008" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="size-large wp-image-6008" alt="The false summit of Mt Adams, from a few hundred feet below the lunch counter." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/01/2013-08-03-10.22.51-1024x577.jpg" width="1024" height="577" /> The false summit of Mt Adams, from a few hundred feet below the lunch counter.[/caption]</p>
<p>I couldn't even see lunch counter above the glacier I was on.  All I could see was the false summit.  Hikers cresting the false summit looked like little dots.  Like one father-son pair who'd already turned back to camp from exhaustion, I courted the idea of giving up.</p>
<p>I turned around to look for my climbing partner, and caught a glimpse of him just below me.  That, and a stunning view.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_6011" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="size-large wp-image-6011" alt="The valley below Mt Adams, through which I had been hiking for 6 hours." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/01/2013-08-03-14.33.18-1024x577.jpg" width="1024" height="577" /> The valley below Mt Adams, through which I had been hiking for 6 hours.[/caption]</p>
<p>It's so easy for me to get hung up on an end goal and forget about the hard work that's taken me to where I already am.  Looking back at those still climbing the mountain isn't a way of looking <em>down</em> on them - it's a way of reflecting on the obstacles over which I've already scrambled.  An opportunity to help those coming along next.  And a chance to change dread of the future to eager anticipation.</p>
<p>This realization forced me to stop where I was and pen the following psalm:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dwell not on the obstacles ahead;<br />
Rejoice in those over which the Lord has already carried you.<br />
For the nature of tomorrow is not set,<br />
But yesterday can not be taken from you.</p>
<p>It's brought me great encouragement, particularly when faced with new challenges and ever-present <a title="Embracing the Imposter Syndrome" href="http://chrislema.com/embracing-impostor-syndrome/">imposter syndrome</a>.  I hope you'll find it useful, too.</p>
