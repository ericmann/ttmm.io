excerpt: In a community steeped in so much confusion about the names, duties, and
  roles of various players, why are we still confusing the conference issue when it
  comes to WordCamp SF?

<p>The WordPress community is often fraught with confusion. What's the relation between WordPress.<em>com</em> and WordPress.<em>org</em>? Does Automattic own the WordPress software? What about the trademark on the name? How is the WordPress Foundation related to everything else? Do we <em>have</em> to use a capital P?</p>
<p>Some of the confusion is innocuous enough. Knowing whether or not to use a capital P won't end your career in the industry. Misunderstanding which WordPress-related support forum you should use to ask a question will have you referred to the correct location in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>Some confusion, though, can be rather damaging.</p>
<p>Knowing how to promote a product or business without violating the "only promote open source" rule of the WordPress community is a tricky slope for many. I've seen speakers have videos pulled from WordPress.tv because of casual mention of a non-GPL marketplace. Some mistakes can be costly.</p>
<h2>WordCamp</h2>
<p>When it comes to the WordCamp community, there are little things <em>more</em> confusing than WordCamp San Francisco.</p>
<p>Before I professionally joined the WordPress world, I looked at WordCamp SF as the end-all be-all of WordCamp experiences. It was the "official" conference of the community. If you spoke there <em>once</em> that resume point carried far more value than speaking at any other (or any combination of) regional WordCamp.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I missed WordCamp SF for several years due to other obligations. When I finally <em>did</em> make it to the conference, I was under the impression things had changed.</p>
<p>WordCamps, as a whole, were scaling back. Gone were the days of large, summit-level events located around the globe. Instead, WordCamps were meant to be organized <a title="About WordCamps" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/about/">by and for a <em>local</em> community</a> and <a title="WordCamp Planning" href="http://plan.wordcamp.org/planning-details/speakers/">should encourage a <em>minimum</em> of travel</a>, both by organizers and speakers.[ref]According to WordCamp guidelines, 80% of your speakers should be local. WordCamp SF often ignores this rule, and they're the one and only exception to it.[/ref]</p>
<p>These changes made all WordCamps, <em>including</em> WordCamp SF, seem a little less grand in my mind.[ref]I came from a world where tech conferences cost $400 or more per person and almost universally required travel to attend. $20 WordCamps present a far different expectation, and just calling WordCamp SF a "WordCamp" lumps it into the same boat <em>regardless </em>its final cost.[/ref] People still traveled from all over the world to attend, but the emphasis on WordCamps[ref]In general, not WordCamp SF itself.[/ref] being "local conferences for the local community" was not lost on me.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_6505" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://eamann.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screenshot-2014-07-30-17.00.41.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6505" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/07/Screenshot-2014-07-30-17.00.41-300x115.png" alt="Is WCSF the &quot;official&quot; conference of the WP community, or isn't it?" width="300" height="115" /></a> Is WCSF the "official" conference of the WP community, or isn't it?[/caption]</p>
<p>This is why I was so surprised to see a particular question on a WordCamp quiz the other day.</p>
<p>It reminds us that WordCamp SF is <em>not</em> a local WordCamp. It stands alone as the "official annual conference of the WordPress project" itself, necessarily dwarfing all of the other conferences.</p>
<p>Should local events compete with the scale and scope of WordCamp SF? If so, what does that mean for SF as the "official" community conference? If not, then <em>why does WordCamp San Francisco carry no additional branding or distinction setting it apart from other WordCamps?</em></p>
<p>From an outsider looking in, the only difference between a WordCamp in SF and a WordCamp in Portland is the location. From a sponsor's perspective, from a new attendee's perspective, from a new speaker's perspective they're the same. But the "official" status of SF changes all of that for those of us who've been in the community a bit longer.</p>
<p>Does WordCamp SF have this right in the first place? If so, why and why are we, as the WordPress/WordCamp community, comfortable with that position?</p>
<p>In a community steeped in so much confusion about the names, duties, and roles of various players, why are we <em>still</em> confusing the conference issue when it comes to WordCamp SF?</p>
