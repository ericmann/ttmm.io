excerpt: I am a derivative work and I know exactly from whom my life, thoughts, and
  behaviors are derived. Do you?

<p>The WordPress world has seen it's fair share of arguments over rights due to derivative work.</p>
<p>What can you do with it? What <em>can't</em> you do with it? Where exactly is the line between derivative and non-derivative?</p>
<p>The holy ways started about GPL, MIT, Apache, and who cares whatever license are endless.</p>
<p>They've also made me think.</p>
<h2>You are a Derivative Work</h2>
<p>Whoever you are, and wherever you come from, there is someone who came in your place before.</p>
<p>First, you are <em>someone's </em>child. Like it or not, your parents' presence (or absence) has influenced you. Your life, your personality, your character. You are, in however minor a way, a derivative work of your parents.</p>
<p>Second, you live in a world with other people. People you respect; those you despise. Whether you look up to someone, resent them, or merely avoid them on the street, the <em>presence </em>of others has and will make an impression on you.</p>
<p>Argue if you like, but you are a derivative work, influenced heavily by the lives, histories, and personalities of the other people in your life. Your family, your friends, even your enemies. As a derivative work, outside observers are likely to see the fingerprints of these influences when they look at you, your life, and your work.</p>
<p>What does that mean to you? How accurate a reflection are you of your parents' values? Of your friends' political inclinations? Or lessons learned from your enemies' misfortunes?</p>
<p>What right do you have to call your reflection of the above your original creation? If your reactions to stimuli are modeled after those of others, do you have the <em>right</em> to call them your own?</p>
<h2>I am a Derivative Work</h2>
<p>I am a Christian. That means, first and foremost, I try to model my life after that of Jesus Christ. My reactions, the way I treat people (whether I know them or not), and the way I relate to the world.</p>
<p>I'm not perfect, but I hope my life is an accurate enough reflection to be seen as derivative of his perfect example. That others would recognize his impact on my being <em>immediately</em> is my utmost goal.</p>
<p>If I am to be an accurate representation, it means I question frequently my right to claim certain things as my own. My success at work, for example, is not my own but is hard-won through my faith in Christ. What right do I have to claim credit for accomplishments earned by leaning wholly on him?</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>My life is a derivative work, and I know both of whom it's derived and why.[ref]I live my life trying to follow Christ's example above all others, but there are other examples after which I model my life, thoughts, and opinions as well.[/ref] <em>You</em> are a derivative work as well; do you know of whom?</p>
