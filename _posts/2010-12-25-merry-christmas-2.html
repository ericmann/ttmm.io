<p>I'm never really been a fan of Christmas music.  Chalk it up to two winters working retail in large malls and shopping centers, listening to endless reprises of the same tired old music over and over and over and ... you get the picture.  You can only listen to recordings from the 1950s or a young Michael Jackson singing <em>I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus</em> so many times before you tire of listening to the radio.</p>
<p>But this year, I've heard some interesting new music.  Remixes of old carols with new melodies and choruses.  Even a handful of completely new songs, too.</p>
<p>So today, while you sit warm by the fire with family and celebrate a day of rest, here's my new favorite Christmas song from this year: <em>His Favorite Christmas Story</em> by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/capitallights">Capital Lights</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He met her up in Delaware in 1937<br />
She was wearing red lipstick to match her pretty dress<br />
December 24th at a quarter till eleven<br />
is when he finally gained the courage to ask her to dance</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was the night before Christmas, it was love at first sight<br />
The carolers sang as they danced through the night<br />
She was a small town girl, he was a traveling guy<br />
He never caught her name before they said their goodbyes</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A couple years later he was out on the road<br />
Having Christmas dinner in a diner alone<br />
When he saw a young waitress with a gleam in her eye<br />
Her favorite day of the year she showed her spirits were high<br />
She said sir can you shed a little holiday cheer<br />
A simple Christmas story was all she wanted to hear<br />
He looked prepared with a smile as he started to say<br />
here's my favorite Christmas story about a girl with no name</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He said I met her up in Delaware in 1937<br />
She was wearing red lipstick to match her pretty dress<br />
December 24th at a quarter till eleven<br />
is when I finally gained the courage to ask her to dance</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Every holiday season as he traveled he'd tell<br />
about his Christmas dance partner that he never knew well<br />
He'd share his favorite story with the locals he met<br />
He was called the Christmas story tellin traveling man</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By age 53 he had done settled down<br />
All the neighborhood kids liked to gather around<br />
Just to listen to his stories about his life on the road<br />
All he had now were these children he told<br />
And every Christmas eve they showed up before dark<br />
He'd tell them all the story but they knew it by heart<br />
They could quote it word for word, he always told it the same<br />
It was his favorite Christmas story called the girl with no name</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He said I met her up in Delaware in 1937<br />
She was wearing red lipstick to match her pretty dress<br />
December 24th at a quarter till eleven<br />
is when I finally gained the courage to ask her to dance</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Twenty years later as he took his last breaths<br />
On a cold Christmas morning in a hospital bed<br />
The children had grown, he had nobody left<br />
Except the little old nurse who was holding his hand<br />
He said Ma'am can you share a little holiday cheer<br />
A simple Christmas story was all he wanted to hear<br />
But his eyes filled with tears at the words that she spoke<br />
Because his favorite Christmas story was the one that she told</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She said I met him up in Delaware in 1937<br />
Though I never caught his name he was a traveling man<br />
December 24th at a quarter till eleven<br />
I'm so glad he got the courage to ask me to dance</p>
