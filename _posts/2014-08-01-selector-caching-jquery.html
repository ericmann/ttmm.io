<p>One of the first critiques I find myself writing while I review JavaScript code is "cache your selectors."</p>
<p>Like me, many JavaScript developers are self taught and worked their way through a basic understanding of scripting through tutorials. Unfortunately, many tutorials sacrifice cleanliness for brevity, leading to functional snippets of code that look absolutely horrible in larger collections of code.</p>
<p>The worst offender is the way developers handle jQuery selectors.  Most commonly, I see things like [cci]$( this )[/cci] repeated several times within a callback function. Or [cci]$( '#selector' )[/cci] used throughout a script to both bind and unbind multiple events.</p>
<p>What new developers don't realize is that every call to [cci]$( something }[/cci] asks jQuery to rescan for the matching element, wrap it in a jQuery object, and <strong>create a new instance of something you already have</strong> in memory. If your code crashes due to memory cascades, overuse of redundant selectors might be related.</p>
<p>Actually, if you use a more advanced IDE like <a title="PhpStorm" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> or <a title="WebStorm" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>, the IDE itself will alert you to this issue so you can correct it.</p>
<h2>Caching Selectors</h2>
<p>In a small application, caching selectors isn't that difficult. Just declare all of your objects at the top of your closure and use the new variables throughout your script.</p>
<p><code lang="js">var $window = $( window ),<br />
    $document = $( document ),<br />
    $footer = $( '#footer' ),<br />
    $sidebar = $( '#sidebar' ),<br />
    $images = $( 'img' );</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the length of your application grows, the size of this selector cache grows and becomes difficult to manage. I've been experimenting with different forms of in-memory caching for JavaScript applications, and came up with a simple selector cache <em>object</em> that makes it easier to wrangle your references.</p>
<p><code lang="js">function Selector_Cache() {<br />
    var collection = {};</p>
<p>    function get_from_cache( selector ) {<br />
        if ( undefined === collection[ selector ] ) {<br />
            collection[ selector ] = $( selector );<br />
        }</p>
<p>        return collection[ selector ];<br />
    }</p>
<p>    return { get: get_from_cache };<br />
}</p>
<p>var selectors = new Selector_Cache();</p>
<p>// Usage $( '#element' ) becomes<br />
selectors.get( '#element' );</code></p>
<p>Using [cci]selectors.get( something )[/cci] in your code from that point forward might be slightly more <em>characters</em> than the redundant selectors we've used previously, but it's far more performant. Once you run code through a minifier, the character count difference will be negligible anyway.</p>
