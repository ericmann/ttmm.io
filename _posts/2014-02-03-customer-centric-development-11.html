<p>Over the past several days, I've been going in to further detail about the <a title="Ten Lessons on Customer-Centric Development" href="http://eamann.com/slides/ten-lessons/">10 lessons in customer-centric development</a> I covered at <a title="WordCamp Phoenix" href="http://2014.phoenix.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Phoenix</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 1" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-1/">Know your customer's story</a></li>
<li><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 2" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-2/">Who is your <em>customer's</em> customer?</a></li>
<li><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 3" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-3/">"User" is a four-letter word</a></li>
<li><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 4" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-4/">Nothing you do is "easy"</a></li>
<li><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 5" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-5/">They hired <em>you</em> as an expert</a></li>
<li><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 6" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-6/">Dates and timelines matter; not hours</a></li>

<li><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 9" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-9/">On-stage versus Off-stage</a></li>
<li><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 10" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-10/">Whatever your role, <em>you</em> are responsible for customer satisfaction</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Since WordCamp Phoenix was so awesome, though, I decided to crank this list all the way up to 11:</p>
<blockquote><p>No list is exhaustive</p></blockquote>
<p>I deliver the list of lessons above out of my own experience.  This list isn't actually <em>everything</em> I'd want to tell you on customer-centric development or business, but is an unordered list of 10 things I feel are not talked about enough in our industry.</p>
<p>That said, you're welcome to disagree with any point I've made as, really, this list might not even apply to you or your business at all.  It does, however, present good food for thought and great discussion points for us to identify the commonalities and differences between our businesses and experience.</p>
<p>I always encourage people to be wary of anyone claiming to be an "expert" or offering some sort of comprehensive "everything you need to know about X" list.  Such lists are misleading and do more disservice to the industry than benefit.</p>
<p>Remember, this list of "10 lessons" are really "10 talking points" and are meant to be a starting point for thinking about a client-focused business.  What lessons would you add?  Which ones would you take off the list?  Which ones would you change?</p>
