<p>I've traveled a lot since I left the .Net world. Back in the day I went to 2, maybe 3 conferences a year - WordCamp Portland plus a .Net conference or two.</p>
<p>I presented at <a title="WordCamp Phoenix 2012" href="http://2012.phoenix.wordcamp.org/">my first conference</a> shortly before exiting that job.</p>
<p>Since moving to WordPress (and open source) full-time, I've attended more conferences than I can count and spoken at more than a dozen (7 in 2013 alone). Attending a conference is a huge privilege. <em>Speaking</em> at a conference even moreso.</p>
<h2>Team Summits</h2>
<p>In April of 2013, 10up held their <a title="First Developer Summit" href="http://10up.com/blog/10up-2013-developer-summit/">first developer summit</a> in Portland. Countless hours went into this event, and the content we covered was far more densely-packed than <em>any</em> open conference I'd been to before or since.</p>
<p>We learned about Vagrant. We established Git workflows. Some experimented with Grunt for the first time. Several <a title="Grunt WP Plugin" href="https://github.com/10up/grunt-wp-plugin">internal</a> <a title="Grunt WP Theme" href="https://github.com/10up/grunt-wp-theme">tools</a> were born in that team meeting, and it proved that we could accomplish truly great things when co-located for a short period of time.</p>
<p>I missed our annual meeting last October for the sake of <a title="10up and jQuery go to Russia" href="http://10up.com/blog/10up-jquery-russia/">jQuery Russia</a>. Following co-workers via Twitter showed me it was just as successful an event, and I'm sad to have missed it.[ref]I wouldn't trade my experience at jQuery Russia for the world, though. If only I could be in two places at once![/ref]</p>
<p>Today, team 10up embarks on our next "<a title="10up Learning Summit 2014" href="http://10up.com/blog/learning-summit-2014/">learning summit</a>." We've grown in size since last April, and our team has grown in <em>scope</em> as well.</p>
<p>What began as a purely developer-focused meetup now features <em>three separate tracks</em> - adding design and project management to the fold and fully fleshing out our team.</p>
<p>This isn't the team I joined just under 2 years ago; <strong><em>it's better</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>A team 10up summit is far better than any conference - I get to spend a few days talking code, design, and client management with the best minds in the business. It's an honor to be counted among the team, and I fully expect my colleagues to blow me away once we all hit the ground.</p>
<h2>What's In Store</h2>
<p>We'll be covering topics from analytics to JavaScript to WordPress.com VIP. We'll talk about design process, SASS, and in-browser design. We'll delve deeply into site evaluations, scrum methodologies, and project post-mortems.</p>
<p>That's just Wednesday.</p>
<p>Today is filled with team-building and communication exercises (followed by what's been promised to be an amazing team dinner).</p>
<p>Thursday is an all-day hackathon where the entire team can come together to accomplish tasks that require tactile presence. I, for one, am looking forward to working through ideas quickly, in-person, on a whiteboard (one of the few tasks I've yet to perfect doing remotely).</p>
<p>This week I get to bump elbows with and learn from some of the most talented engineers, designers, and managers in the business. Want to see what's in store for a 2015 meeting? <a title="We're Hiring" href="http://10up.com/contact/">We're hiring ...</a> ;-)</p>
