excerpt: I've discovered yet another trend with traffic on my site.
---
<p>I've discovered yet another trend with traffic on my site.</p>
<p>Firstly, traffic here seems to wane on weekends. I'm perfectly OK with that, and I can usually boost weekend traffic by publishing a controversial article or two. The blowback from controversy on a Saturday is far less than and I'd see on, say, a Tuesday.</p>
<p>Second, the majority of my traffic comes within the first two hours after I publish a post. I've been publishing <em>daily</em> at 8am Pacific every day this year. I see traffic start to pick up at about 7:30 and drop off around 10. If I re-post my article to Twitter around lunch, a smaller spike of traffic usually follows.</p>
<p>Trying to figure out the <em>best</em> time to publish has always been an iterative process.</p>
<p>The new trend I've noticed is topical.</p>
<h2>Traffic</h2>
<p>I see the most traffic when I write technical articles.</p>
<p>Obviously the world sees me as a developer, so more people tune in when I'm writing about developer-y topics. Some of my most-read articles are tutorials on version control or configuring Vagrant on Windows.</p>
<p>I'm OK with people tuning in for these articles. That's why I wrote them in the first place - partly to help teach others, partly to help validate my own learning on the subject.</p>
<p>When I write about anything else - business, faith, politics, writing itself - my traffic drops as much as 60%. I'm still receiving <em>some</em> visits, but usually merely thanks to search aggregates pointing new readers at my existing tutorials.</p>
<p>When I publish a somewhat popular technical article, I might see total daily traffic of 600 unique visitors - 120 of which are hits to the newly-published article. On low (non-technical) days, I see traffic of maybe 350 uniques - 30 of which are hits to the new article.</p>
<p>It's definitely a non-trivial difference.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>Ironically, I usually see more audience interaction with my non-technical posts.</p>
<p>My tutorials usually receive a handful of re-tweets or response posts. My non-technical articles, however, receive these kinds of interaction in far greater numbers; sometimes people are retweeting a post on hiking <em>months</em> after I published it.</p>
<p>The number of email, Skype, Twitter, LinkedIn notes, and even site comments I get from readers in response to my <em>non-technical</em> posts absolutely dwarfs what I get from their technical cousins. Come to think of it, I've only ever had one person talk to me <em>directly</em>[ref]I.e. reach out via email, Skype, or any channel other than a blog comment.[/ref] about one of my technical posts.</p>
<p>People contact me <em>weekly</em> to discuss my non-technical work.</p>
<h2>Reconciliation</h2>
<p>Like anyone else, I am a complex individual with a multitude of interest. I will not stop writing about the things that matter most to me: technology, faith, business, politics, and creative writing. However, I do recognize that each topic speaks to a different audience.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I separated this site into multiple discrete sites - each with their own domains. My business site contained only business content. My creative writing site only creative writing. My faith site only articles about faith. At the time, I was just getting started in <em>blogging</em> on tech, so I had a decision to make - spin up a separate site or abuse the topical separation of one of my existing domains.</p>
<p>I chose neither option. Instead, thanks to insight from <a title="Don’t Use WordPress MultiSite" href="http://halfelf.org/2011/dont-use-wordpress-multisite/">Ipstenu's post about categories and WordPress MultiSite</a>, I merged the three existing sites into one, cleared out some legacy "hello world" content that had little to no value, and introduced my new personal blog.</p>
<p>It's been great to move all of my content under one domain, and has definitely made the process of producing <em>daily</em> content far easier on me. But it's come at a cost to my readers. If you come here for technical content, there's no guarantee that I'll be meeting your expectations tomorrow.</p>
<p>I've actually had people subscribe via email based on a tutorial, only to angrily unsubscribe (and yell at me about it) the next day when I post an article discussing scripture or prayer.</p>
<p>Are my site topics different enough to warrant separation into discrete sites? Maybe, but managing <em>three</em> sites does little to aid cross-topical discovery. Some of the most encouraging comments I've received are along the lines of, "I came to read a technical article and found your post on Philippians. Thank you so much for this! I didn't expect to find both in the same place!."</p>
<p>For this reason alone, I want to keep all of the content on one site. I <em>do</em> however, want to make it easier for readers to opt-out of seeing content they don't care about. I also want to make it easier to surface unexpected content that might benefit the reader.</p>
<p>I also want to work towards a way to produce more content across <em>every</em> category rather than sticking to just one post per day. Unfortunately, I only have <a title="Do they deserve the gift of your keystrokes?" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoTheyDeserveTheGiftOfYourKeystrokes.aspx">a finite number of keystrokes in me</a>, and I'm not sure I can do that all on my own.</p>
<p>The next few months will see me more regularly experimenting with content formatting and organization. Perhaps even inviting a few guest bloggers (or even a ghost writer or two). It's up to you to let me know whether or not any of these changes are effective.</p>
