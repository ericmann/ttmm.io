<p>I recently made the argument that <a href="http://eamann.com/tech/wordpress-shadow-taxonomies/" title="WordPress and Shadow Taxonomies">abstraction layers are a bad idea</a>. It's not the most popular of opinions.</p>
<p>It <em>is </em>one that I stand by whole-heartedly.</p>
<h2>In the .Net World</h2>
<p>I once was tasked with building an entire wed CMS from scratch in C#. Before you panic, know that it was an exciting project!</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to learn about URL mapping, MVC principles, query optimization, and caching. I also learned how to navigate a sharded, load-balanced cloud hosting infrastructure.</p>
<p>It was a blast!</p>
<p>But I also learned that ASP.NET hid a lot of nastiness under the hood of its abstraction layer. Luckily, I'd invested in a copy of .NET Reflector, so I could easily identify that nastiness.</p>
<p>The biggest offender was the built-in cache.</p>
<p>In .NET, you can declare a view[ref]A method that populates and renders a page template.[/ref] as cached just by decorating it with an attribute. It's simple, powerful, and means you don't have to touch the caching layer at all.</p>
<p>Well, if you're using HTML explicitly, that is.</p>
<p>My web app exposed a handful of JSON endpoints for consumption by an API. After we launched, we opted to enable caching on these endpoints to alleviate some of the database load. I added the attribute; our API ceased to work.</p>
<p>It turns out the built-in cache for that version of .NET automatically rewrite the content type of the returned document to "text/html."</p>
<p>That meant my cached JSON endpoints, my cached XML endpoints, my cached <em>file </em>endpoints - they were all declaring themselves as HTML documents!</p>
<p>Trusting the abstraction layer led to hundreds of angry customer calls, hours of debugging for me, and an eventually rewriting of the default cache to avoid the issue.</p>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<blockquote><p>We don't need someone who knows JavaScript, they just need to know jQuery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I've heard the above - verbatim - from a hiring manager. The concept terrifies me.</p>
<p>I love jQuery. It's a fantastic way to keep your code light and cross-browser compatible. The powerful Deferred object is one of my favorites.</p>
<p>But if you're writing code for jQuery without understanding the underlying JavaScript it's built upon, you're setting yourself up for a world of pain. &nbsp;I once worked with a jQuery-based table library that was pretty powerful, had a fully-featured front-end UI, and possessed the worst performance of any library I've ever seen.</p>
<p>For small tables, the library worked just fine. &nbsp;For larger tables, though, it became an endless memory sink.</p>
<p>To work around the lack of [cci]:hover[/cci] support in IE6, the library added a mouseover event to each cell of the table to automatically change the cell's class so it would be properly highlighted. &nbsp;The way the library did this, however caused issues. &nbsp;Here's some (horrendous) pseudo code to show how the library was functioning:</p>
<p><code lang="javascript">$( 'table td' ).each( function() {<br />
    $( this ).mouseenter( function() {<br />
        $( 'table' ).find( '.hover' ).removeClass( 'hover' );<br />
        $( this ).addClass( 'hover' );<br />
    } ).mouseleave( function() {<br />
        $( this ).removeClass( 'hover' );<br />
    } );<br />
} );</code></p>
<p>If it's not immediately obvious, the above is a bad idea. &nbsp;First, it's&nbsp;<em>recreating</em> the jQuery object containing the table on every iteration of the table cells in [cci].each()[/cci]. &nbsp;Second, it's binding an event to&nbsp;<em>every single cell in the table.</em></p>
<p>For a small table, you probably wouldn't even notice. &nbsp;The table I was building, however, had 30 columns across 300 rows of data - meaning this library was binding&nbsp;<em>900 discrete mouseover events</em> just to handle animating the table as the cursor moved across the screen!</p>
<p>On Internet Explorer, it took 5 minutes to load the entire table.</p>
<p>I rewrote the library - creating my own fork - to instead bind a single (throttled) mouseover event on the table itself that used event delegation to detect when the cursor hovered over table cells.</p>
<p>My rewrite took the table load time down to 10 seconds.</p>
<h2>Understand What You're Doing</h2>
<p>I'm not saying abstraction layers have no purpose in development. &nbsp;When you know what you're doing, certain tools can save considerable time and make your application more stable.</p>
<p>But when you&nbsp;<em>don't</em> understand the underlying principles used by your abstraction layer of choice, you can run into issues. &nbsp;Errors due to underlying framework assumptions. &nbsp;Performance issues. &nbsp;You name it.</p>
<p>I like abstraction layers because they make life easier for developers. &nbsp;I&nbsp;<em>dislike</em> abstraction layers because they raise issues for new developers who have yet to master them.</p>
