excerpt: How long did it take you to flesh out the foundation of a WordPress plugin
  the first time you did it? How long does it take you today?

<p>Every summer as a kid, I'd pack some things and head off to Boy Scout summer camp. I'd pack a couple of weeks beforehand, not because I was that on top of things, but because the older scouts required a "pack check" from the entire unit at least a week before we left.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised how much we'd fit into a pack, only to find out we'd forgotten something important. Like pants. The pack check was <em>hugely</em> useful.</p>
<p>Still, I always felt like packing took a long time. A typical summer camp trip would have me packing for a at least a week. Knife. Water Bottle. Rain Gear. Compass. Each of these were little things, but they all added up quickly.</p>
<p>My first year as a Scout, my backpack weight over 50 pounds. I had a change of clothes for every day of the week. Extra food for if I decided the camp fare wasn't good enough. Letter-writing materials so I could attempt to write home. Come to think of it, I <em>still</em> can't imaging how I managed to pack so much and have that much weight ready for the trip.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I've got several more backpacking trips under my belt. My bag now weighs just under 10 pounds (without water), and this is <i>including</i> carrying my own tent and cooking rig. Then again, I've learned what to prioritize - and figured out the kinds of things I can leave at home.</p>
<p>You don't <em>really</em> need two sweatshirts and two pairs of bluejeans for a weekend trip.</p>
<p>Now I travel more frequently for conferences than backpacking trips, but I'm still lucky to have the packing experience. It takes me 15 minutes to pack everything I need for a week-long trip now. And I use a bag 1/3rd the size 11-year-old me used. It's amazing how much I can get into a bag - and still have room left over - and swear I'm missing something.</p>
<p>Everything we do in life requires practice - be it packing for a trip or fleshing out the boilerplate code for a new project. Getting started, both kinds of tasks can drag on for <em>hours</em>. As we become more and more experienced, though, each task becomes easier and is completed even more quickly.</p>
<p>How long did it take you to flesh out the foundation of a WordPress plugin the <em>first time </em>you did it? How long does it take you today?</p>
