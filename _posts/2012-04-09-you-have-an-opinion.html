<p>When I write software, I ask for people's opinions.  Then, I either listen to what they have to say or I don't.</p>
<p>Some people are very adamant about certain features, options, or use cases. Sometimes I listen, sometimes I ignore them entirely.</p>
<p>It's nothing personal. I have opinions about <a href="http://wordpress.org">certain applications</a> that should be ignored as well.  Features, options, and experiences that are important to me aren't important to the overall process or the product's <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpresss-htaccess-file-is-inadequate?replies=16#post-2740122">actual end user</a>.</p>
<p>Am you entitled to have an opinion of my work?  Yes.  But I'm just as entitled to disqualify it for the following two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of Standing</li>
<li>No Credibility</li>
</ol>
<p>Want to know <em>why</em> I disqualify opinions in these two categories?  Then read the latest post on Seth Godin's blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/04/is-everyone-entitled-to-their-opinion.html">Is everyone entitled to their opinion?</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps, but that doesn't mean we need to pay the slightest bit of attention.</p>
<p>There are two things that disqualify someone from being listened to:</p>
<p>1. Lack of Standing. If you are not a customer, a stakeholder or someone with significant leverage in spreading the word, we will ignore you. And we should.</p>
<p>When you walk up to an artist and tell her you don't like her painting style, you should probably be ignored. If you've never purchased expensive original art, don't own a gallery and don't write an influential column in ArtNews, then by all means, you must be ignored.</p>
<p>If you're working in Accounts Payable and you hate the company's new logo, the people who created it should and must ignore your opinion. It just doesn't matter to anyone but you.</p>
