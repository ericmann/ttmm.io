<p>On <a title="Telling Your Own Story" href="http://eamann.com/biz/telling-your-own-story/" target="_blank">Monday</a>, I proposed we analyze a market entry situation.  We have three market segments to consider and must determine who our perfect customer (story teller) would be: <strong>Dock Dwellers</strong>, <strong>City Slickers</strong>, or <strong>Locals</strong>.</p>
<p>Considering that fishing is a seasonal activity, we need to focus on customers who will be around year-round: the <strong>Dock Dwellers</strong> and <strong>Locals</strong>.  These two segments live in the area and will be most likely to frequent our little corner of the world when not searching for bait.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can't really target both segments.  The <strong>Dock Dwellers </strong>are outdoorsmen, shopping for fishing gear one season and stocking up on other sporting goods in the next.  The <strong>Locals</strong> are families in the area who would most likely come in for a loaf of bread or gallon of milk.  We can definitely provide for both needs, but we can only build our brand for one.</p>
<p>Both of these segments will be loyal, but we choose to target the one that will bring in additional customers.  Our third segment, the <strong>City Slickers</strong>, will be most effected by the <strong>Dock Dwellers</strong> during fishing season.  Remember, the <strong>Dock Dwellers</strong> spend "their days fishing and chatting with tourists" and the <strong>City Slickers</strong> "usually seek out the <strong>Dock Dwellers</strong>after they get lost."  This high level of segment interaction helps us identify the <strong>Dock Dwellers</strong> as the most appropriate segment to target when we enter the market.</p>
<p>Look back at <a title="Telling Your Own Story: Part II" href="http://eamann.com/uncategorized/telling-your-own-story-part-ii/">the last time we used this scenario</a>.  See how we arrived at the same conclusion?</p>
<p>Now we sign our lease and begin buying merchandise - always keeping the needs of our target customers in mind.  Our store layout will be catered specifically to the Dock Dwellers, although we will keep some basic home goods on stock for the Locals.</p>
<p>In order to create our brand and tell our own story, we need to thoroughly understand who we want our audience to be.  Our perfect customer is the one who will carry our story to others.  Knowing what kind of story they would <em>want</em> to tell is the first step to building our brand and successfully entering the market.</p>
