excerpt: Seeing athletes who've trained for a half decade just to put on a few minute
  (or in rare cases an hour) long performance is breathtaking.  To see hours and hours
  of effort over weeks, months, and years culminate to a brief moment in front of
  the camera is awe-inspiring.

<p>Watching <a title="NBC Olympics" href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/">the Olympics</a> is always an incredible experience.</p>
<p>Seeing athletes who've trained for a half decade just to put on a few minute (or in rare cases an hour) long performance is breathtaking.  To see hours and hours of effort over weeks, months, and years culminate to a brief moment in front of the camera is awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>A single mistake can cost <em>everythin</em><em>g</em>.</p>
<p>It's humbling to compare this kind of preparation and performance with my own industry.  I'm grateful every day that my months and years of experience don't come down to a single, 4-minute long performance.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't think I could take that kind of pressure.</p>
<p>In software development, mistakes are learning opportunities.  The server crashed? Great; figure out why and make sure to protect against that failure in the future.  Your code fataled? Great; take some time to learn what you did wrong and correct the mistake.</p>
<h2>How Old is Old?</h2>
<p>I <a title="Three Decades Down" href="http://eamann.com/journal/three-decades/">turned 30</a> last year, and feel I am just hitting my stride when it comes to software.  I work with a solid team, build fantastic projects, and learn something new in the field each and every day.</p>
<p>There are several developers in the market who are older than me, all of whom are incredibly impressive.</p>
<p>There are other developers younger than me, again all of whom are incredibly impressive.</p>
<p>Watching the Olympics, I constantly hear commentators remark about athletes' age.  Last night, a 31-yr old figure skater was called an "old man" and everyone was surprised he was still competing.  Apparently he's retiring soon as well.</p>
<p>I just can't imagine that.</p>
<p>Yes, athletic events are much more physically demanding on the body than sitting at a desk writing code.  But the idea that athletes have a "prime" after which they can no longer compete makes me wonder if developers do, too.</p>
<p>How long will we continue to be not just productive but revolutionary in our careers?  When will the innovative ideas start to wane?  How long until a developer begins to show his or her age and is deemed "old" by outsiders?  By <em>insiders?</em></p>
<p>Considering I'm just now hitting my stride, I wonder how long I'll be able to maintain it.</p>
