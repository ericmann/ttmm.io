<p>Just to forewarn you, this might come across as a more technical post than I normally throw at you.  Still, I did something exciting last night that I wanted to share and perhaps educate you about.</p>
<p>I built a custom XML-RPC server.</p>
<p>And with that statement I know I've already lost most of you.  Rather than get too much into the details, XML-RPC stands for <em>XML Remote Procedure Call</em>.  It's a way for one server to send information to another for processing - like posting inter-office mail to another department.</p>
<p>XML is just a way to code information.  You split up the message into chunks and label it.  For example, you can send a message via XML-RPC that asks to multiply two numbers together.  You'd code a 2 as <code>&lt;int&gt;2&lt;/int&gt;</code> to mark it as an integer.  This way the server knows what kind of information it's reading and what to do with it.</p>
<p>My particular server is meant to handle and report errors created by <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/ericmann" target="_blank">my open source WordPress plug-ins</a>.  I write more than one, and several hundred websites use them.  Unfortunately, when they break for whatever reason I rarely hear about it ... so I can't fix it.  Hopefully this new system will give me a way to monitor my own performance and step it up a bit.</p>
<p>I'm calling the system "Elliot" after the main character in <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/" target="_blank">E.T the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em>.  I was inspired by the thought of my plug-ins "phoning home" to tell me whether or not they're working.</p>
<p>Will this make things better for me?  Time will tell, and I'll definitely keep you apprised of my progress!</p>
