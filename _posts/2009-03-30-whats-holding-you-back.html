<p>The other day, someone asked me what appeared to be the most unassuming question possible.  "If there was something you could start doing today that would improve the quality of your life, what would it be?"</p>
<p>On the surface, this seemed to be a very harmless question.  I almost had an answer.  Then I stopped to think for a minute.  <em>If there is something I <strong>could</strong> start doing right now, why haven't I started doing it yet?  What's holding me back?</em></p>
<p>This leaves me wondering: if there's something I could do in my business that would drastically improve its standing in the market, what would it be?  More importantly, why haven't I started doing it yet?</p>
<p>Maybe this is a question you should ask yourself as well.  What could you be doing?  What <em>should</em> you be doing?  Most importantly, what's holding you back and keeping you from doing it?</p>
