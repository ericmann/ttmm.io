excerpt: One of the things I miss most from my C# coding days is output parameters.

<p>One of the things I miss most from my C# coding days is output parameters.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't seen them before, output parameters are relatively simple. They're parameters that you pass&nbsp;<em>in</em> to a function that are modified by the function itself, essentially allowing you to return multiple values from a single function.</p>
<p>I often used these to pass in and return flags relating to the relative success of the internals of a function in C#. Usually, my functions were built in such a way that they&nbsp;<em>always</em> returned a value (usually a fallback), so as to allow the program to continue in the event of remote API failures.</p>
<p>Passing a [cci]flags[/cci] parameter allowed me to programatically check whether or not the API call was successful, which in turn informed how I cached the function's return value.[ref]In most cases, API failures would be retried on a parallel thread so end users were more likely to see cached data on their second attempt.[/ref]</p>
<h2>A WordPress Problem</h2>
<p>The other day, I found myself needing a similar feature in a WordPress project. I was building code that would automatically generate a shortlink via a remote API - the problem was the function would be used on&nbsp;<em>front-end</em> requests and needed to&nbsp;<em>always</em> return something useful.</p>
<p>I originally wrote a function very similar to the code below:</p>
<p><code lang="php">function get_shortlink( $post_id ) {<br />
  // Get a cached shortlink<br />
  $shortlink = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'shortlink', true );</p>
<p>  if ( false === $shortlink ) {<br />
    $longlink = get_the_permalink( $post_id );<br />
    $shortlink = generate_shortlink( $longlink );</p>
<p>    // generate_shortlink() will always return a link of some sort, usually<br />
    // the full URL if there was a failure.<br />
    if ( $shortlink !== $longlink ) {<br />
      add_post_meta( $post_id, 'shortlink', $shortlink, true );<br />
    }<br />
  }</p>
<p>  return $shortlink;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>My issue is that there's no simple/effective way to tell the difference between a shortened URL and a regular post/page URL.[ref]In the code above, I just assume they're different. However, you can have minor differences in your links that trigger an in-code inequality but still map to the same path. The project I was working with, for example, was erroneously returning the canonical ([cci]?p=XXX[/cci]) URLs in a [cci]get_the_permalink()[/cci] inside the [cci]get_shortlink()[/cci] function and assuming success. This led to several hundred URLs being inaccurately mapped ... a serious issue for the site in question.[/ref] I&nbsp;<em>really</em> wanted to add an output parameter to the function so I could test whether or not it had successfully generated (and cached) the short URL.</p>
<p>So I added one.</p>
<h2>Pass by Reference</h2>
<p>PHP supports passing parameters by reference. It might not be&nbsp;<em>called</em> an output parameter, but you can fairly easily create something that will serve the same purpose.</p>
<p>My function turned out looking something like:</p>
<p><code lang="php" height="415">function generate_shortcode( $longurl, &$created ) {<br />
  // Assume failure from the beginning<br />
  $created = false;</p>
<p>  $path = add_query_arg(<br />
    array(<br />
      'u' => $longurl,<br />
    ),<br />
    'http://someurlshortener.com'<br />
  );</p>
<p>  $request = wp_remote_get( $path );</p>
<p>  if ( is_wp_error( $request ) ) {<br />
    return $longurl;<br />
  }</p>
<p>  // If not an error, then the URL was shortened.<br />
  $created = true;</p>
<p>  return wp_remote_retrive_body( $request );<br />
}</code></p>
<p>And I can&nbsp;invoke it like:</p>
<p><code lang="php">function get_shortlink( $post_id ) {<br />
  // Get a cached shortlink<br />
  $shortlink = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'shortlink', true );</p>
<p>  if ( false === $shortlink ) {<br />
    $longlink = get_the_permalink( $post_id );<br />
    $shortlink = generate_shortlink( $longlink, $created = false );</p>
<p>    // If the flag is true, then the function worked.<br />
    if ( $created ) {<br />
      add_post_meta( $post_id, 'shortlink', $shortlink, true );<br />
    }<br />
  }</p>
<p>  return $shortlink;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>After invocation, I can test the value of [cci]$created[/cci] in my other code and immediately know whether or not I should cache the return of the function.</p>
<p>How else might you use output parameters (or an implementation thereof) in your code?</p>
