excerpt: Back in 2011, I was talking at WordCamp Portland with a few people about
  how we could use WordPress to replace our presentations. Fast forward to 2013, and
  I get to make that dream a reality. We just launched seoslides, and it's already
  making a huge impact on my content!

<p>Not often do I get to talk about the cool stuff I do at work in concrete, non-NDA terms.  But today is different, and I'm excited.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, I was talking at <a title="WordCamp Portland" href="http://portland.wordcamp.org">WordCamp Portland</a> with a <a title="Taylor Dewey" href="http://tddewey.com">few</a> <a title="Michael Fields" href="http://wordpress.mfields.org/">people</a> about how we could use WordPress to replace our presentations.  PowerPoint and Keynote were great, but bulky and non-portable. Tools like <a title="Shower Presentation Engine" href="http://shwr.me/">Shower</a> and <a title="Impress JS" href="http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored">Impress</a> are beautiful, but unapproachable for non-developers.  We wanted a way to build our WordPress presentations in WordPress and distribute them the same way.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2013, and I'm given the opportunity to work with a <a title="10up" href="http://10up.com">fantastic</a> <a title="Alorum" href="http://alorum.com">team</a> to develop <a title="seoslides" href="https://seoslides.com">seoslides</a> - a first-of-its-kind presentation builder <em>completely housed within WordPress</em>.<!--more--></p>
<p>I've been using development versions of seoslides since <a title="WordCamp Seattle" href="http://seattle.wordcamp.org">WordCamp Seattle</a> last June.  It's based on many of the tools I was already using to build HTML presentations, but with no need to hand-edit the markup to build a presentation.  Instead, seoslides has an awesome what-you-see-is-what-you-get drag-and-drop canvas editor.  You can embed text, images, and even YouTube and Vimeo videos.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning!</p>
<p>The team at <a title="Alorum" href="http://alorum.com">Alorum</a> has also put together two awesome SaaS[ref]Software as a Service[/ref] systems to go along with the plugin.  The first of which is an import-from-PDF service.  Now, all of your legacy PowerPoint and Keynote presentations can be imported into seoslides as graphics.  For proof, check out the embedded presentation below - from my <a title="WordCamp Portland Lightning Talks" href="http://2013.portland.wordcamp.org/session/lightning-talks/">WordCamp Portland lightning talk</a> last month.</p>
<p>[seoslides embed_id="f7fcb525da71" script_src="http://eamann.com/embed-script/wcpdx-2013/5675/" overview_src="http://eamann.com/slides/wcpdx-2013/" site_src="http://eamann.com" site_title="Eric A Mann" title="WordCamp Portland 2013" /]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second hosted service is where the added bonus lies.  It's a presentation sharing community, <a title="seoslid.es" href="http://seoslid.es">called seoslid.es</a>.  Using seoslides, you can push your presentations to this external site and embed them there.  This means your content, displayed on another domain.  Because of the way seoslides is engineered, <em>every view of seoslid.es</em> is traffic for your site.</p>
<p>seoslides was just launched, so I've had my presentations syndicated on seoslid.es for only a week.  <i>And my site traffic has already seen an impact!</i></p>
<p><a href="http://eamann.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/stats.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5824" alt="WordPress Stats" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/09/stats.png" width="901" height="222" /></a>In all honesty, I'm very biased towards this plugin.  I've spent more time with it than just about any other piece of code I've ever worked on; but I'm also incredibly happy with the result and with the efforts of the entire team involved!  I have no doubt you will be as well.</p>
<p>So, if you already use WordPress, <a title="seoslides on WordPress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/seoslides">install seoslides today</a> and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!</p>
