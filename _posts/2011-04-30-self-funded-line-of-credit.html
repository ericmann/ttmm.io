<p>I was thinking this past week of ways to save money, and I realized lately how "odd" my primary strategy seems to other people.  I'm in the process of paying off my credit cards, so when I need to make a large purchase I give myself <em>a self-funded line of credit</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, I give myself a loan.  A loan that I pay back.  Think of it as my checking account taking out a credit card from the Bank of My Savings Account.  I make monthly payments, charge myself interest, and actually <em>make</em> money on my purchases.</p>
<p>Think about that.  <strong>I make money when I buy things!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Here's a simplified example of how it works:</p>
<h2>A Typical Model</h2>
<p>Mark wants to buy a new computer.  He takes a look at his finances - there's $50 in checking and $2000 in savings.  Based on his income, he can afford payments of $100/month on the new machine without having to scrape by too much.  But he doesn't want to give <em>everything</em> away, so he uses his Visa to buy the computer.  He now has $50 in checking, $2000 in savings, and owes $2000 on his Visa.</p>
<p>Let's assume the Visa accrues interest at 12% APR and the saving account makes 2% in interest.  Using those numbers, it will take 24 months (2 years) to pay off the credit card entirely if Mark pays $100 each month.  But thanks to compound interest, Mark has paid a total of $2,242 over the two years (remember those annoying finance charges?).</p>
<p>Mark's $2000 computer ended up costing him $2,242.  But that's OK!  After two years he still has a fancy new laptop and his savings account (thanks to 2% interest) now has $2,078 in it.  Not too bad!</p>
<h2>My Atypical Model</h2>
<p>Judy also wants to buy a new computer.  She takes a look at her finances and, like Mark, has $50 in checking and $2000 in savings.  She figures out that a $100/month payment will be affordable on her salary without breaking the bank.  She's a savvy spender, so rather than taking out a loan from someone else or borrow against a credit card, she issues herself a <em>self-funded line of credit</em> against her savings account.</p>
<p>Let's assume that Judy charges herself 12% APR on the line of credit and her savings account makes 2% in interest.  Using those numbers, it takes 24 months to pay off her line of credit paying $100 each month.  Just like Mark, Judy will pay a total of $2,242 over the two years (remember, she's charging herself interest on the line of credit), but all of that is put into her savings <em>where it earns additional interest at 2%!</em></p>
<p>Judy's $2000 computer ended up costing her $2000 because she didn't borrow money from anyone else.  After two years, she has a fancy new laptop, and her savings account (thanks to the 12% financing and 2% interest) now has $2,284 in it.</p>
<h2>See the difference?</h2>
<p>Both people start out in the same boat - they want to spend $2000.  Mark, by borrowing from someone else, pays that person finance charges.  He's made $78 in interest on his savings, but paid an extra $242 in finance charges on the loan.  In the end, he's <strong>lost $164</strong> by using a credit card to make the purchase.</p>
<p>Judy, by borrowing money from herself, pays herself the finance charges.  She's made a total of $284 on her savings, and hasn't paid anything extra to anyone else.  In the end, she's <strong>made $284</strong> by using a self-funded line of credit to make the purchase.</p>
<p>Which would you rather do?  Buy a computer and lose money?  Or buy a computer and <strong>make money?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>If both Mark and Judy have more than $2000 in savings, they will earn more interest.  Assuming they both have $12,000 in savings but still follow the above plan to buy $2000 computers, Mark will end up having <em>earned</em> $247 after you deduct finance payments from his earned interest.  Judy will have earned $696 in interest and will have paid nothing in finance charges.  Even taking additional savings into account, Judy ends up almost $450 richer than Mark when everything is said and done.</p></blockquote>
