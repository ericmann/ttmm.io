excerpt: Would you be more or less likely to read a site that interspersed timeless
  legacy yet still-relevant content amongst it's "latest posts" feed?

<p>Twitter, Facebook, and just about every other social network in existence has experimented with some sort of sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>They track the behavior of their users and compare the content discussed and shared on the different social networks. This presents different charts in different scenarios: community mood, reaction to current events, some have even used this analysis to <em>predict</em> events or behavior based on the community's mentality.</p>
<p>As different firehoses of data are made available to the public - Twitter recently announced they were availing their entire database to researchers - I wonder if there are other ways to use the information.</p>
<h2>Content Presentation</h2>
<p>Blogs, like this one, are presented chronologically. New visitors only see the <em>newest</em> content on the site, not necessarily the best or most interesting. I wonder how difficult it would be to present different content under different circumstances.</p>
<p>Say there's a debate on net neutrality in Congress on the floor today - my site could automatically tweet articles about similar content and surface some of that content in the "river" on the homepage of the site.</p>
<p>The bulk of the content presented on the homepage would still be chronological. A few pieces of timeless legacy content relevant to current affairs, however, could pop into the feed and continue to contribute to the conversation.</p>
<p>Would such a malleable presentation help or hinder content on an otherwise chronological site?</p>
<h2>Search Filtering</h2>
<p>Oh how I hate that Google and the like strip of search terms when they refer traffic to a site. If not for the fact that Google encrypts search terms, we could very easily determine topics most searched for and surface relevant content more readily in the homepage's river of content.</p>
<p>I am aware that tools like Google AdWords and Webmaster Tools make more of this content available. Since many sites are <em>already</em> integrated with Analytics, this would require tightly integrating with <em>even more</em> Google properties. I'm not so much a fan of that, but it would be an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>In all, the ability to surface content that might be more relevant to the community's interests at the moment might increase readership (or at least time-on-site). Considering single-author blogs that only change their front page layout daily (or less frequently), I doubt it would be more disruptive than, say, higher-volume publications that shift their homepage several times per day.</p>
<p>Would you be more or less likely to read a site that interspersed timeless legacy yet still-relevant content amongst it's "latest posts" feed?</p>
