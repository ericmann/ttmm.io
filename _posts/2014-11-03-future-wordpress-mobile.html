<p>Last week, the team behind the Android app for WordPress <a title="WordPress Android App Version 3.3" href="https://apps.wordpress.org/2014/10/30/wordpress-android-app-version-3-3/">released version 3.3</a> of their application. As an Android phone user, I think this is fantastic, and I upgraded immediately.</p>
<p>However, I'm also a Windows user ... and am still waiting for a quality app I can use on Windows to manage my WordPress sites.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I used Windows Live Writer. It was a great little app that allowed me to easily push content to WordPress and preview things I was working on before I published. What's better, it allowed me to work entirely <em>offline</em> so I didn't need to worry about whether or not I had WiFi before drafting an article.</p>
<p>I usually kept a few local drafts saved to my machine and would polish them over a few weeks before publishing them.[ref]I honestly wish I took more time to polish each of my articles <em>here</em> before publishing. Alas, while I can be disciplined enough to publish regularly, I have yet to establish a consistent editorial calendar.[/ref] Unfortunately for me, Live Writer only maintained <em>its own drafts</em> and refused to pull down existing drafts or publications from a live site.</p>
<p>I could create in Live Writer. Publish from Live Writer. Edit from Live Writer. But if the article originated in WordPress itself, it was invisible to the desktop product.</p>
<p>This sucks.</p>
<p>I love the Android app because it allows me to draft (locally, without WiFi), push drafts to WordPress, <em>pull existing drafts </em>from<em> WordPress</em>, and edit whatever I need to. Unlike Live Writer, it also integrates with comments and, thank goodness, WordPress.com statistics for when I need an ego boost.[ref]Or I just want to see how many people hated an opinion I have enough to re-share my article for community ridicule.[/ref]</p>
<p>Unfortunately (again) the Android app doesn't run on a Windows machine.[ref]Well ... it does. But I had to boot up a bunch of local emulation software to make it work. Not very sustainable, and not very user-friendly.[/ref]</p>
<p>Neither does, obviously, the iOS app. Or the Windows Phone app.</p>
<p>Actually, the Windows Phone app has been deprecated (according to a statement by Matt Mullenweg during his the <em>State of the Word</em> address). I was able to get it to run on my Windows machine (again, thanks to local emulation) but it felt like I still had a way to go to be on-par with the Android app.</p>
<p>In  a world where more often we assume users are already connected and online, I have to wonder how permanent the shift away from desktop will become. WordPress itself is fully responsive for a great mobile experience, but the admin interface still relies on heavy server-side code. If you're not online, WordPress (in its current state) is nearly unusable.</p>
<p>The mobile apps are a bit better, allowing local drafts and management. But still, they're <em>mobile apps</em> that run on phones. I use the mobile app for short posts or quick edits to existing media. I have yet to write a piece of content longer than 200 words on my phone. The input aesthetic for mobile sucks.</p>
<p>I'm not making any grandiose predictions about the future here, just making an observation about trends. The trends seem to suggest a growing emphasis on mobile usage and a growing assumption that we're always connected. I'm personally at odds with both - I think mobile and desktop <em>both</em> have their uses, and I frequently seek ways to work while <em>not</em> being connected.</p>
<p>Is there room in the future for both mindsets?</p>
