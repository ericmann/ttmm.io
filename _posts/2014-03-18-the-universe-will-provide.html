<p>I often bemoan a mantra related to open source development that I heard at a WordCamp when I was first getting started.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do your best work. Give it away for free.  The Universe will provide.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounded like a great idea at the time.  I'd just discovered open source software, and I was absolutely in love with the open, community-driven nature of it.</p>
<p>Companies were held up as stellar examples of multi-million dollar enterprises who'd built a product, given it to consumers <em>for free</em>, and still been able to monetize and stay afloat through other means.  I wanted to achieve that kind of success.</p>
<h2>Flexible Ethics</h2>
<p>In graduate school, I took a wonderful class on cross-cultural sales practices.  I call it "wonderful" because it helped me build wonderful connections and taught my a lot about myself by showing me how much the business world is filled with things I loathe.</p>
<p>One lesson in particular was how bribery and political corruption was <em>normal</em> in some cultures and to avoid it on ethical principles would set me up for failure in business.  Needless to say, that pretty much turned me off at pursuing a career in international sales.</p>
<p>My professor took me out to lunch to discuss it with me.  He applauded my reservations to shady business practices, but at the same time suggested I needed to relax my grip on black-and-white moral principles so I could work more effectively in the market.</p>
<p>I highly respect this professor, but I disagree in his stance on principles.  If you hold something to be a guiding truth, you need to live by it <em>at all times</em>.  If you can't live by it, then it must not be a truth.</p>
<h2>Does the Universe Provide</h2>
<p>I've been developing plugins for WordPress since I started in open source.  To date, my free plugins have racked up almost 100,000 downloads.  I've supported the plugins with multiple version updates, bug fixes, and feature additions.</p>
<p>At the time each plugin was released, they represented my "best work."  I gave them away entirely for free.</p>
<p>I'm still staring at a huge IOU from the universe.</p>
<h2>Monetizing Free Software</h2>
<p>I've tried various ways to retain the "free"ness of the products I give away.  Unfortunately, my efforts have been faced thus far with total failure.</p>
<p>I tried charging for support - I had 1 subscriber who later asked for a refund since he didn't actually need support.</p>
<p>I tried charging for feature additions - this evolved to an unsustainable business model as clients wanted their changes to be proprietary and, the longer I insisted on opening them to the world, they turned to other developers instead and still built upon my free base.</p>
<p>I tried a Kickstarter-like donate-for-your-favorite-feature campaign for two of my plugins  - I received several votes of confidence, but $0 in total.</p>
<p>In late 2011, I took the time to conduct actual research to see if there was a monetization strategy that would actually work.  Of the people I interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>33% would not pay any amount for specific feature development</li>
<li>40% would not pay any amount to support ongoing development</li>
<li>80% would not pay for "priority" or "early release" updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Most surprising, of the 50% of interviewees who said they <em>would</em> pay to contribute to ongoing development - a not insubstantial ongoing payment of $25/year - a total of <strong>0%</strong> have actually contributed over the past 3 years since the interview.</p>
<h2>How Principled are We?</h2>
<blockquote><p>If you hold something to be a guiding truth, you need to live by it <em>at all times</em>.  If you can't live by it, then it must not be a truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>I tried freelancing for a few years before taking a steady "real" job with an employer.  I continued to freelance for a few years beyond that on the side as well.  I learned a lot about making money from open source software, but one thing in particular: if you give it away for free, no one will give you anything in return.</p>
<p>The universe included.</p>
<p>Perhaps I've grown a bit cynical, but when I see larger WordPress shops making money off premium products I have to wonder.  On the whole, these products are open source - so they're <em>free</em> in the sense that I can do whatever I want with them after I have a copy.</p>
<p>Well, until I try to resell the product on my own.  Or until I give it away for free.  Or until someone notices I installed a copy on yet another client site.</p>
<p>Despite the product being "free," the WordPress community jumps on people doing any of the above quickly and furiously.</p>
<p>This is the same community that taught me the above mantra - and which claims to live by it.</p>
<p>I still look at the big players in the open source community - not just WordPress, but the surrounding community as a whole - and I still want my share of that success.  But every day I work with open source I see more clearly: our community is no more principled than any other in the business world.</p>
<p>I shudder at the thought of what that means for our future.</p>
