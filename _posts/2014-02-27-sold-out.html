<p>Supply and demand.  It's one of the most important principles in economics.</p>
<p>Consequently, it's also of massive importance to marketing.</p>
<h2>Scarcity Drives Margins</h2>
<p>In 2013, the average price for a football ticket was $81.54.[ref]<a title="National Football League average ticket price from 2006 to 2013 (in U.S. dollars)" href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/193425/average-ticket-price-in-the-nfl-since-2006/">National Football League average ticket price from 2006 to 2013 (in U.S. dollars)</a>[/ref]  For less than a hundred dollars you could attend a professional football game at just about any stadium in the country.</p>
<p>The average price for the 2014 Super Bowl: $3,480.  That's more than a 4000% increase over the season average.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is not just "the" game of the year, it's also a hugely limited commodity.  Throughout the year, you can watch games on TV and lose count of the empty $80 seats in the stands.</p>
<p>The highly limited nature of the <em>one</em> Super Bowl of the year, however, means two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The game is absolutely certain to sell out</li>
<li>Tickets will go for insane amounts in both primary and secondary markets - the most expensive Super Bowl ticket available carried a price of almost $450k![ref]<a title="Super Bowl 2014: Ticket prices not dropping on eve of game" href="http://www.nj.com/super-bowl/index.ssf/2014/02/super_bowl_2014_ticket_prices_not_dropping_on_eve_of_game.html">Super Bowl 2014: Ticket prices not dropping on eve of game</a>[/ref]</li>
</ol>
<p>This phenomenon isn't strictly applied to high-end entertainment.  In college, I worked at a summer camp that had a small camp store.  We sold program materials, souvenirs, and snacks.</p>
<p>The year Vanilla Coke came out, I had the luck to have 2 cases hidden in my tent.  My brother, the supervisor of the camp store, wanted to see if he could sell them - the store otherwise sold only Pepsi products and its nearest competitor was 17 miles down the hill.  A can of Pepsi cost $0.35; my brother priced the Vanilla Coke at $5.</p>
<p>He sold out in an hour.[ref]After a fit of guilt, my brother refunded the kids who'd bought the far-too-expensive soda and issued an apology.  But the fact that someone was willing to pay 1400% <em>more</em> for a can of soda just because it was rare shocked everyone.[/ref]</p>
<h2>Digital Goods Are Cheap</h2>
<p>I own a few digital albums that claim to contain "rare" recordings of older songs performed by my favorite bands.  That these albums are, first, digital and, second, classified as "rare" amuses me.</p>
<p>I purchased the album once, and have the same song on my PC, my Mac, my iPod, my Droid, and my Kindle.  The music is so rare that it takes me a whopping 5 seconds to make as many copies as I want.</p>
<p>Digital goods, by their very nature, cannot be made scarce.</p>
<p>In other words, the <em>supply</em> of a digital product is effectively infinite.  As a result, the incremental <em>cost</em> of producing such a product is effectively nil.</p>
<h2>Race to the Bottom</h2>
<p>As more and more vendors enter the digital space, they try to make the same competitive moves they made with physical goods.</p>
<p>Namely: cutting margins.</p>
<p>Once a digital product is compiled, bundled, processed, or uploaded, though, the incremental cost of producing duplicates drops to 0 - meaning the lowest margin is giving the product away for free.</p>
<p>That's not sustainable for anyone.</p>
<h2>Can Digital Goods be Sold Out?</h2>
<p>I ordered a table the other day.  Actually, I ordered it over a month ago - but I won't get it for <em>another</em> month because it's currently sold out.  Even though it's already paid for, the fact that I can't have it <em>right now</em> just makes me want it more.</p>
<p>But can this sentiment be applied to digital goods?  Can there be a hard limit on the number of digital records sold?  On the number of eBooks available?  On the number of software downloads released?</p>
<p>Would this limitation raise the price?</p>
<p>Is there a way, short of evil DRM restrictions, to effectively limit the <em>supply</em> of a digital good and thus raise its value?</p>
