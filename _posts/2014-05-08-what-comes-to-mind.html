<p>As I carry through my objective to blog daily in 2014, people continue to ask me how I devise daily topics.</p>
<p>I've already spoken at length about <a title="How To: Blog Every Day" href="http://eamann.com/writing/blog-every-day/">my email strategy</a> - rather than responding to one-off "how to" messages, I'll write my response as an article and email a link. I've also spoken (in person at least) about my Twitter strategy. I will poll the community for ideas and watch for developing trends I can weigh on.</p>
<p>Often the more interesting conversations require more than 140 characters - taking my thoughts to a blog helps me lay things out in more detail. It also makes for a more persistent medium upon which to have the conversation (since Twitter will otherwise bury our chat under the firehose of endless data).</p>
<p>When faced with writers' block, though, I'll often just write about whatever comes to mind.</p>
<h2>Working through Issues</h2>
<p>The topic I cover the most on this site is technology - primarily WordPress. I work with WordPress in my day job, so I'll often come across problems and solutions related to WordPress.</p>
<p>I'll then <em>write</em> about these problems and their affiliated solutions, not just so I can engage the community, but so <em>I</em> won't forget what I was doing at the time.</p>
<p>The number of times I've tried to search for an issue on Google, and been directed to an older tutorial on my own site is laughable - it happens at least once a month. It's great that I have a place to catalog my efforts so I can come back and recall how I've solved the problem before.[ref]It's a bit disturbing I need an outside tool to remember any of this, but I'll concede the point and use it nonetheless.[/ref]</p>
<p>Working through work-related code challenges helps me in other ways, too. By explaining the problem in an article - as well as the solution I devised - I'm forced to get both out of my head and in front of someone else. More often than not, this helps re-cast the issue in my mind as well, and I'll sometimes come up with a different (superior) solution than the one I'm already using.</p>
<p>In this way, my blog serves as a persistent <a title="Rubber duck debugging" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber ducky</a> when it comes to explaining my code.</p>
<p>If you want to write more in 2014, take some time to catalog your work - the challenges you've faced and the solution you devised to overcome them. The article might help a colleague someday - better yet, it might help <em>you</em>.</p>
