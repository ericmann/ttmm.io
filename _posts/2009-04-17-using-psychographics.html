<p><strong>Question Number 3: How do you gather psychographic data?</strong></p>
<p>All of you market researchers are scratching your heads already.  <em>Yes, we know what psychographics are, and we know why they're important.  Now tell us how to get them and use them!</em> Really, it's not as hard as you might think.  It just takes a bit more time than typical statistics.</p>
<p>Demographic information is easy.  You ask a handful of profiling questions in a research survey and count the answers.  I know, it's a bit more complicated than that to actually <em>analyze</em> the data, but I'm talking about pure collection.  Statistical data is all in the numbers.  While psychographic data can be reduced to numbers, it's grounded in qualitative data first.</p>
<p><strong>Survey Question:</strong> What is your household's average annual income?</p>
<p><strong>Demographic Answer:</strong> $60,000</p>
<p><strong>Psychographic Data:</strong> Everything else they said, the tone of voice used when answering the question, the interviewee's posture, etc.</p>
<p>In a psychographic interview, you want to do as little talking as possible - but you should be taking a <em>lot</em> of notes.  If the interviewee answers a question, the way they answer is just as important as the answer itself.  Did they smile thoughtfully when the number rolled of their tongue?  Did they seem a bit frustrated that another market research wanted into their wallet?  Did they answer quickly so you could move on to the rest of the survey?</p>
<p>By itself, this one question doesn't tell you much about the individual.  But in reality, you're looking for trends throughout the interview.  There's a lot that body language can tell you about someone's opinions of a product, whether they say they like it or not.  You should be focused on <em>everything</em> so you can paint an accurate story around this interview.</p>
<p>Then you throw it in the bucket with all of your other interviews, shake lightly, and pull out a psychographic profile of your perfect customer.</p>
