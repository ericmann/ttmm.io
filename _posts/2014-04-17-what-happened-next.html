<p>The title is absolute link bait, and a reference to a call I made on Twitter last night:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/EricMann/status/456597510912360448</p>
<h2>Link Bait</h2>
<p>I absolutely hate sites like BuzzFeed. UpWorthy is growing ever closer to being on my personal do-not-click list as well.  Just about all of their articles are some sort of top-10, top-20, or top-43 list that has absolutely zero impact on my life.</p>
<p>The "what happens next" articles are even worse offenders.  They have all the makings of a stories with unexpected twists, but are merely devious attempts to trick readers into clicking through thanks to a half-hearted cliffhanger.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it's admirable to find new and inventive ways to draw readers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you need to resort to <em>tricking</em> readers into reading your articles, then I'd argue your content isn't of a high enough quality to deserve to be read.[ref]I recognize the irony of my using a similar title for this post. I'm trying to make a point - if you clicked through from Twitter, thank you. You might be interested in some of <a title="WordPress Archive" href="http://eamann.com/tag/wordpress/">my other articles on WordPress</a> as well. If you feel tricked into reading this article, I invite you to stay anyway and promise to never resort to such devious SEO-gaming techniques again.[/ref]</p>
<h2>OK, so what happened?</h2>
<p>Now that I've duped you into reading an article,[ref]I feel really dirty doing this. It won't happen again. Ever. Promise.[/ref] let me actually answer the cliffhanging question.</p>
<p>Last year, I opened <a title="Deprecate `get_permalink()`" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24164">a WordPress ticket</a> proposing we deprecate the [cci]get_permalink()[/cci] template tag in favor of [cci]get_the_permalink()[/cci] for consistency among our template tags.  My ticket was a bit selfish, as I've personally used [cci]get_the_[/cci]  functions that don't exist more times than I can count.</p>
<p>Introducing [cci]get_the_permalink()[/cci] would cut down significantly on the number of typos I introduce to my own code. After talking to several other developers at WordCamps and meetups, it turns out I'm not the only one who makes this mistake.</p>
<p>There was an ongoing debate on the ticket, and eventually <a title="Changeset 27409" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/27409">my patch was accepted</a> - last month - and released as part of WordPress 3.9.</p>
<p>Was this unexpected? Yes and no. I never expected this particular patch to land in core, but I did expect the ongoing discussion on the idea.  The WordPress community is an incredibly social and helpful one, so I never doubted we'd come together and actually discuss any proposed idea.</p>
<p>Even an idea not explicitly requested by members of the core team.</p>
<p>Do you have an unrequested patch lying around somewhere? Put it on Trac; you might be surprised by the response!</p>
