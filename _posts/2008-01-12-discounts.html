<p>Every store advertises sales and discounts in today's market.  But how much value does a discount or clearance rack actually have?</p>
<p>I currently work in a store that sells luxury goods.  Our clearance items are 40-60% off and, for the next few days, we give an additional 20% off.  The big numbers and "Save Now" advertisements drive a lot of traffic to the store and we are liquidating a lot of old merchandise ... and still making a profit from it.</p>
<p>In a competitive market, prices need to match market demand.  While it may only cost $2,000 to build a sports car, you can't sell it at less than the going market rate of about $20,000 without destroying your business.  Demand outstrips supply and you find yourself the target of negative public relations for failing to produce what is asked of you.  <strong>But</strong>, you can build the same sports car sell it at $20,000 with an advertised 30% off (selling now for $14,000).  Consumers feel they're getting a great deal by shopping with you, and you still make a huge profit.</p>
<p>We do this so often now that I fear discounts and so-called savings (many of which are advertised the same time the product is released) have adversely affected the consumer's perception of value.</p>
<p>Every item in our store that does not have an advertised discount carries a "discretionary discount."  This is a certain percentage we can give the customer if we feel they are not going to buy.  The problem is, <strong>every</strong> customer expects a discount on <strong>every</strong> item in the store.  This is not just a problem with luxury goods, though.</p>
<p>Many people go grocery shopping based on what discounts and sales are advertised in the weekly paper.  When was the last time you made a shopping list and <em>didn't</em> try to find coupons for everything on the list?  There are some people who even start with the coupons and make a shopping list based on the grocery store's advertised sales.</p>
<p>Has price and discount advertising adversely affected the value perception of consumers in your industry?  What tools have you used to combat this problem?</p>
