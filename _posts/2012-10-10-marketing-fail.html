    Columbia Sportswear when the flagship store draws customers in with products they
    don't even sell.

<p>While walking back to my car this weekend from the Portland Marathon Fitness Expo, I had the chance to swing by the <a href="http://www.columbia.com/">Columbia Sportswear</a> flagship store. I love that place, and I love seeing their new displays of fantastic products.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one <em>major</em> marketing failure made Saturday the exception.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Lately, I've been on the lookout for a new utility pack. <img width="179" height="300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2012/10/sorel-bag-179x300.jpg" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5373" /> Something small and functional to balance my large trekking backpack - something I can use for a weekend travel bag with just the essentials. Ideally, I'd like something rustic, too. I don't know why, but a classic rucksack appeals to me.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, Columbia had one prominently displayed in their window. Not one, but two. With a great lifestyle shot showing a woman travelling in style on the train, too! It looked like exactly the bag I was trying to find.</p>
<p>So I sacrificed a few minutes - I was on my way to another appointment - to head inside and look for the bag. Who knows, my birthday is next month and maybe I've found a gift to give myself.</p>
<p>For one, the customer service in the flagship store is fantastic. I was barely through the door before a woman came to help me.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  "Can I help you find something today?"</p>
<p>  "Yes, actually, I wanted to get a closer look at one of those bags you have on display over there."</p>
<p>  "Oh, those? We don't actually sell those. It's just part of the display."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I'm not kidding. Those were her exact words. The flagship store - the store who's sole purpose is to show off the newest and best products the brand has to offer - is <em>displaying</em> a product they don't even sell.</p>
<p>If the hook that gets your customer in the door is a product you don't even offer, then something is seriously wrong with the way you're taking your brand to market. Here was a good $150-200 that Columbia forfeited to REI over a simple bag. Multiply that by the number of people walking by and through their flagship store and it's a significant loss to the company.</p>
<p>Is your marketing helping or hurting your attempts to work with customers?</p>
