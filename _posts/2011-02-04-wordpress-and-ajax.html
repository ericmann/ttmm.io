<p>This post is long overdue. For that, I apologize. Now, on to the fun!</p>
<p>Everyone knows I love WordPress.  I build my websites on the platform.  I write plug-ins for other sites.  I recommend it to all of my clients.  I've even contributed code to core. Let's stipulate for now that I think WordPress is awesome.</p>
<p>Those of you who know and follow my work also understand how much I enjoy working with JavaScript - particularly with Ajax.  There's something about making user interfaces work so smoothly that just speaks to me.  Like art for web geeks.  And Ajax just has a cool name.</p>
<p>When I first got started with WordPress, though, there was very little Ajax involved.  I really mean there was basically zero JavaScript used anywhere.  It was boring, old-school, and the admin UI wasn't fun to navigate <em>at all</em>.  Every new plug-in that came out, though, screamed "we have Ajax-y goodness!"  It was one of many buzzwords going around, so I jumped on the bandwagon and tried my hand at the new system.</p>
<p>And I failed.  Miserably.</p>
<p>It took me quite a while to get good enough with JavaScript to even attempt to use Ajax in any projects.  I bought three books that claimed to teach me the ropes.  I worked with 3 or 4 different frameworks before finally discovering <a href="http://www.jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> (yay!).  Now I have people asking <em>me</em> for advice on Ajax-powered systems ... so obviously it's something anyone can learn.</p>
<h2>Those of you just starting have an advantage</h2>
<p>A month ago, <a href="http://www.ronalfy.com/" target="_blank">Ronald Huereca</a> contacted me and asked that I take a look at his new book, <em><a href="http://www.wpajax.com/?affiliate_id=162" target="_blank">WordPress and Ajax</a></em>.  I had a lot going on at the time, but I still offered to give the book a fair review and downloaded the eBook version.  A few quick minutes of conversion later and I had a portable version to carry around on my Sony eReader.</p>
<p>I honestly expected it to take me a few days to get through the book - I've never been a fan of technical reading.  To my surprise and amusement, I finished it in a day ... in exactly two sittings!</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.wpajax.com/?affiliate_id=162" target="_blank">WordPress and Ajax</a> </em>covers a lot of ground.  Ronald takes you through the basics of loading scripts into a WordPress system all the way through processing Ajax requests from the front-end of a site.  He even walks you through the development of not one but <strong>two</strong> Ajax-powered plug-ins.</p>
<p>In the world of directly applicable and approachable script snippets, this book is king.  Considering the number of Adobe's "Classroom in a Book" volumes and Programmer-to-Programmer tomes that I own, this is pretty high praise.</p>
<p>When I first dove in, I actually expected the book to be somewhat basic (sorry Ron).  The first chapter is titled <em>What is Ajax</em> and I expected something along the lines of JavaScript 101 as I dug in.  But the humor used throughout the book makes the more basic concepts palatable, and it helps build your confidence before diving in to <a href="http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/06/02/wordpress-203-nonces/" target="_blank">noncing</a> and script localization (two concepts most veteran developers are still figuring out).</p>
<p>I actually learned quite a bit from the book, and I'm already using some new techniques on my own sites, some client sites, and in a couple of plug-ins I maintain.  If you haven't yet, you should pick up a copy.  It's available both in print format and as an eBook - I recommend the eBook because you can quickly alt-tab between script examples and an IDE.  But print format would work well for that as well ... so it's up to you.</p>
