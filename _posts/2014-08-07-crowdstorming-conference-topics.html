<p>Crowdfunding seems to be all the rage these days and is useful for everything from kickstarting <a title="Oculus Rift" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game">a multi-million dollar Facebook acquisition</a> to helping a new cook find and prepare <a title="Potato Salad" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/324283889/potato-salad">potato salad</a>. Love the campaigns or <a title="The Point of Ridiculosity" href="http://eamann.com/journal/point-of-ridiculosity/">hate them</a>, crowdfunding gives entrepreneurs who've reached the end of their rope a creative way to bootstrap their business.</p>
<p>Fall short of creative ideas to raise money, and the community will lend a hand to pick things up and keep going. It's a fantastic concept, but I wonder if it could apply to <em>more</em> than funding.</p>
<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
<p>I often talk about ways to find new <a title="How to blog more: What comes to mind?" href="http://eamann.com/writing/what-comes-to-mind/">blog topics</a> and new <a title="Choosing a Conference Topic" href="http://eamann.com/biz/choose-a-conference-topic/">conference talk ideas</a>. Still, every now and then I fall short of new ideas and need to depend on others to provide a creative <em>kick</em> to get things going again.</p>
<p>Sometimes I head to my email to suss out ideas from contact and support requests. Other times I visit sites like Quora to see what questions and topics are currently abuzz in the world. Still other times I'll ask a friend or two for advice.</p>
<p>But what if, like Kickstarter, you could ask <em>millions</em> of friends for advice?</p>
<p>Crowdsourced brainstorming - or <em>crowdstorming</em> - could become an interesting, sustainable way to gather hundreds of potential topics all at once. Pulling ideas from the community also means the ideas are <em>already of interest</em> to the people you're likely going to address.</p>
<h2>Conference Topics</h2>
<p>The first time I ever crowdstormed a conference topic idea was 2 years ago. I don't have notes as to <em>which</em> conference the ideas were for, but they helped me build a speakers' bureau of several potential talks that I went back to time and again for over a year.</p>
<p>It's time to run <em>yet another</em> poll; I'm hoping you can help me both refine and build a quality speakers' bureau for the coming year!</p>
