<p><a href="http://eamann.com/biz/learning-best/">My team</a> is amazing.</p>
<p>We do wonderful work from remote enviornments. We work odd hours and conduct complex conversations asynchronously using email, HipChat, and BaseCamp.</p>
<p>We occasionally come together in one place to educate and learn from one another. Our first such meetup was April of last year, and it was incredible!</p>
<h2>Team Summit v2</h2>
<p>Late yesterday, we closed our second learning/development summit with no less fanfare. Our team again[ref]Well, not really "again." Last time there were 20 of us. This time we're up to over 60![/ref] gathered together for a time of project reflection, team-building, and collaborative education. The amount one can learn in such a short time js staggering!</p>
<p>This year, though, we added a hackathon to our official schedule of events. If you thought our team was amazing before ... wow!</p>
<p>In one day, we built (from scratch) two brand new WordPress plugins, polished loads of internal tools and documentation, and kicked off the launch of the new <a href="http://10up.com">10up.com</a>.</p>
<p>Our team works remarkably well remotely. Given a day to collaborate face-to-face they're even better.</p>
<p>But like any marathon (read: long-term effort), you can't sprint the entire time. Our team hackathon was productive, yet exhausting. I look forward to a weekend of relaxation before we all hit Monday refreshed, revitalized, and refocused <em>as a team.</em></p>
<p>There's no stopping us now...</p>
