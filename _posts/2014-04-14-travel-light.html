<p>When I watched the film <a title="Up in the Air" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_in_the_Air_(2009_film)">Up in the Air</a>, I was impressed that anyone could travel so frequently with such little baggage.</p>
<p>At the time, I hadn't traveled very much.  When I did, it was mostly on larger group trips - family, school, or trips with friends - where <em>everyone</em> had at least two very large bags.  I didn't think this was anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Then I met a guy on a flight who traveled with <em>only</em> a carry-on. For every trip.</p>
<p>No baggage fees. No waiting for checked bags. It seemed very convenient, but I couldn't figure out how he managed to carry everything he needed in a single bag.</p>
<h2>Enter Backpacking</h2>
<p>In late 2012, I invested in a quality mountaineering bag that was about the size of my old carry-on so I could carry a single bag on my trip to Haiti.</p>
<p>Since the trip involved staying in the mountains, I viewed it more as a camping trip while I planned everything out.  A camping trip means hiking, hiking means a backpack, a backpack means traveling light.</p>
<p>I managed to pack 10 days' worth of clothing and gear into a mountaineering bag with no problems.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Trips</h2>
<p>Since I started working with WordPress full-time, I've also started presenting at open source conferences on a regular basis.  Since Portland is home to relatively few conferences (with respect to the nation as a whole), this equates to quite a bit of travel on my part.</p>
<p>For the first few trips, I still took my regular luggage to the airport.  I skipped checking my bags and opted for a smaller carry-on, but still had some sort of wheeled luggage to handle at the airport and on the plane.</p>
<p>After a while, though, I recalled my trip to Haiti and realized that my 10-days worth of gear for that trip vastly outweighed anything I took to a WordPress or JavaScript conference.  Since early 2013, I have taken a mountaineering bag on all of my trips rather than traditional luggage.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Unlike Ryan Bingham, I'm not going to tell you to empty a figurative backpack of friends, family, and other obligations.  Instead, I want to point out how freeing it's been to be the non-traditional traveler.</p>
<p>I can strap everything to my back and hike from one place to another without a hassle - as I did for several miles in Boston rather than wait and pay for an Uber.</p>
<p>I can easily carry everything down the aisle of the plane, meaning I'm often seated more quickly (and deplane faster) than my co-travelers.</p>
<p>Because my non-traditional luggage is smaller than usual, I take extra care when I pack to make sure I only bring the essentials.  Whereas I used to bring a lot of extra "stuff" on trips (I brought running gear, swim trunks, and 3 books to WordCamp Phoenix one year), I now bring only the things I <em>know</em> I'll need.</p>
<p>Clothing, my Bible, cables to charge my electronics, a neat toiletries kit so I'm not "that guy" after 3 days on the road.</p>
<p>Whittling down what I bring with me on the road has helped pare down what I keep at home, too.  Just the essentials, with a few added nostalgia pieces.  It's made me much happier not having to lug unnecessary junk from one point to another.</p>
<p>The next time you plan for a trip, will you be checking a bag or just living with a carry-on?  How much will you pack?  Did you make a conscious decision to include every item, or did unnecessary junk work its way in?</p>
