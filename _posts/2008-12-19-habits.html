<p>Every morning when I first get on the computer, I point the browser to a few web comics I enjoy.  Starting the day with a nice dose of funny helps me be happier, more productive, and more fun to work with.  There are three web comics I really enjoy, but they all have different update schedules.  One updates weekdays.  One updates weekdays plus Saturday.  One updates Monday-Wednesday-Friday.</p>
<p>Yet for some reason, I load all of them <em>every</em> day.  I know consciously that on Tuesdays I'm loading one too many sites.  I know consciously on Saturday that I'm loading two too many sites.  But still, I load up all three of them.  It's a habit, and loading the sites isn't an act of conscious will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been reading a great marketing book lately: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Habit-95%25-Behavior-Marketers-Ignore/dp/0131357956/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229701813&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Habit</a></span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Habit-95%25-Behavior-Marketers-Ignore/dp/0131357956/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229701813&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">, by Neale Martin</a>.  It's a fantastic book that walks would-be marketers through the difference between the habitual (unconscious) and executive (conscious) minds.  I had never thought that habit played as large a role in my decision making as it does ... then I stopped and thought about my daily web comic routine.  There's nothing conscious about it!</p>
<p>If you're looking for something great to read that will stimulate the conscious part of your marketing brain, pick up a copy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Habit</span> at the bookstore.  It's not cheap, but it's fresh theory that will definitely turn your traditional ideas of marketing strategy on their collective head.</p>
