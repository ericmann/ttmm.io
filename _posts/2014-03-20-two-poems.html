<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>The Treasure Forgotten</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ever feel like you just can’t see it?<br />
There’s something always up<br />
and just to the right, behind you?<br />
That moves when you turn to look?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It’s a memory, long forgotten.<br />
An intimate secret of your mind<br />
even you aren’t privy to<br />
that hides behind what’s remembered now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Could it be the meaning of life?<br />
Or a notion visiting from elsewhere?<br />
A glimpse into another time<br />
where you were someone else; a past life?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think it’s God checking over your shoulder.<br />
Like a too early caller<br />
in the coffee shop down the street,<br />
peering past you to read the headlines.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He stops in from time to time,<br />
gifting memories<br />
to old souls still lingering.<br />
That we would know who we were and could be again<br />
when life feels fruitless and most chaotic.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Not Lost, But Taken Away</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(This poem was written as a response to<br />
and reflection upon <a title="The Most of It" href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/675270-the-most-of-it-by-robert-frost">The Most of It</a> by Robert Frost.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I miss it, all of it.<br />
The deep rich odor of his dry dusty coat,<br />
The one he wore to work on cold mornings<br />
Ensnaring his warmth and essence inside.<br />
Cut off from me oh so suddenly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I miss it, all of it.<br />
His worn, cracked, experienced hands baiting the line.<br />
Teaching through doing all I need to know<br />
To live up to my promise that he so earnestly believed in.<br />
Gone from me now oh so swiftly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I miss it, all of it.<br />
The deep, hearty thunder booming from his belly<br />
On that outing last autumn in the wilderness,<br />
Telling tales of other hunts long past.<br />
Silenced as if by a torrent of water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hate it, all of it.<br />
The bitter taste left in my throat when the sweet is gone.<br />
After Grandpa’s lemon drop has dissolved<br />
So much like his life in those last few minutes<br />
Ever present, ever visible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hate it, all of it.<br />
The dark sheet now covering my ever-beating heart<br />
Like the veil of pain that covered his face<br />
Blocking his eyes from seeing us there as he was wheeled away.<br />
So near, yet so distant.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hate it, all of it.<br />
The longing for his sensible, knowing eyes,<br />
Not dark and glazed as they had become<br />
In those last moments before the sirens stole him away.<br />
So far away from me now.</p>
