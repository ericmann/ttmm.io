excerpt: A close friend of mine asked me the other day why I "waste so much time"
  with fiction.

<p>A close friend of mine asked me the other day why I "waste so much time" with fiction. Watching movies set in space, reading books set in improbably ancient times, writing stories covering both scenarios. Why do I "waste so much time with [my] head in things that will never happen."</p>
<p>Fiction, both speculative (read: sci-fi) and otherwise, is by far my favorite genre for storytelling.</p>
<p>By why?</p>
<h2>Speculation</h2>
<p>I enjoy science fiction because it gives me a chance to look forward to the future and imagine what different things will be like as days go by. On the one hand, you could argue that I will never see frequent space travel or walk on another world.</p>
<p>Considering how much of today's technology was inspired by tales in the realm of science fiction, though, you could also argue that imagining a future I want is the only way that future will ever come to pass. I studied science in college, so I can usually tell how realistic a piece of fake technology may or may not be - the better the pseduo-science, the more likely I am to escape into the story and really consider the ramifications should such technology exist.</p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Fiction also presents the unique opportunity to reflect on current events or current disagreements without calling out the event or disagreement explicitly.</p>
<p>A college professor I highly respect used to carry on conversations with a large stuffed penguin during his lectures. He wasn't crazy, but he did like to crack jokes during class to keep everyone attentive. A few complaints early in his career about the unintended offensiveness of telling jokes directed at students led to the giant stuffed penguin solution - no one ever complained if he accidentally insulted a stuffed animal.</p>
<p>In fiction, you can delve deeply into highly controversial issues without anyone getting upset that you're discussing the issue in the first place. <em>Battlestar Gallactica</em> covered economic issues, social equality debates, racial politics, and a plethora of issues that would have killed any other show quickly - <em>Gallactica</em> threw in a bunch of robots, and that made the conversations OK.</p>
<p>I enjoy fiction because it provides a safe route through which I can consider both the futureÂ <em>and</em> the present.</p>
