<blockquote>They hired you as an expert.</p></blockquote>
<p><a title="Customer-Centric Development: Lesson 4" href="http://eamann.com/biz/customer-centric-development-4/">Lesson 4</a> is a bit of a two-edged sword.  On the one hand, you should never say anything you do is easy.  You're an expert and have invested thousands of hours to learn a craft - what's easy to you is still an insurmountable challenge to others.</p>
<p>At the same time, clients will often try to lessen your expertise; if what you do is <em>actually</em> easy, then it should cost less for you to do it.</p>
<p>Every time someone asks me what I do for a living, the next phrase out of their mouth is often, "oh, neat. My 7 yr-old nephew does that too."  Trying to build a business relationship - one where my time is respected and adequately compensated - becomes nigh impossible if that's where the discussion ends.</p>
<p>Instead, I'll respond with something along the lines of, "oh, he wants to get into this field, too? That's incredible!  Have him give me a call and I'll pass along some tips for classes he can take in high school and college so he can get started on the right foot.  This is a challenging industry, and he'll have an easier time breaking in if he knows where to start."</p>
<p>With rare exception, there is no 7 yr-old nephew (or niece) who can do what we do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, so many client managers will know a kid[ref]I use the term here to paint a specific dichotomy between a youth who "builds websites" and a young web developer.  I know many talented developers under the age of 21, and I bristle when colleagues call them "kids."  It's belittling to refer to any of our contemporaries with child-like terms.[/ref] whom they allege can work at the same level we can.  This is a fallacy that's nearly ubiquitous in our industry, and it has some serious consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Until they truly know you, a client won't trust your judgement.</strong></p>
<p>They hired you as an expert, so you need to act like it.  Offer expert opinions - even when the opinion is "no, that's the wrong way to do it."</p>
<p>Pushing back on client feedback is difficult, but necessary.  They're not the expert developer - if they were, you wouldn't be working with them.  Their teenage kid isn't the expert developer - if they were, you wouldn't be working for them.  The article they read last week on whoever's blog, though they <em>might</em> be an expert, is not the <em>hired</em> expert developer - if they were, the client would hire them instead.</p>
<p>When you speak to a client, speak from an expert position.  If you flat don't know something, explain you need some more time to weigh the alternatives before making a recommendation - <em><strong>never</strong></em> say "I don't know."  You're an expert and expected to make expert recommendations.  Saying you don't know just reinforces the belief that the company intern, the boss's daughter, the fly-by-night blog know more than you and that your judgement is flawed.</p>
<p>They hired you as an expert.  Behave as the expert you were hired to be.</p>
