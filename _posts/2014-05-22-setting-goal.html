excerpt: The mistake I make the most often is getting too far ahead of an idea.

<p>The mistake I make the most often is getting too far ahead of an idea.</p>
<p>I think I've discovered something great, so I share my ideas with the world and begin to build an idea around them. Then I make the fatal mistake and, in the heat of the initial excitement, announce a plan to the world.</p>
<p>I still haven't written a book. I still haven't published a Windows 8 app. The one public goal I've managed to stick with thus far is that of daily blogging. It's been difficult, and has taught me a <em>lot</em> about both setting and keeping an objective.</p>
<h2>Measurable</h2>
<p>Firstly, a goal has to be realistically measurable. "I will write a book" might seem measurable, but has little quantifiable outcome. What kind of book? How long? Where and in what format will it be published?</p>
<p>Some could argue that this site - a daily blog with over 300k words on various topics counts as a book. In addition to my writings on software and faith, it even includes the entirety of a <a title="National Novel Writing Month" href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> novel (50k words of creative prose on a single topic).</p>
<p>But my blog today isn't what I set out to create initially. When I announced I would write a book, I had a specific goal in mind - a study on marketing. My public goal was more ambiguous - a hedge against changing my mind on the topic - and thus, an impossible goal to hold me to.</p>
<p>A better objective would be in the form of "I will write, edit, and publish <em>3D Marketing</em>, a study on storytelling as marketing, by December 31 of this year."</p>
<p>It's clear, concise, and something others can hold me to.[ref]Note, I'm <em>not</em> announcing this book right now. I have other objectives at the moment.[/ref]</p>
<h2>Discipline</h2>
<p>Keeping an objective is difficult. Blogging daily isn't something that comes easy - particularly with a busy schedule that includes traveling for work, attending conferences, and the occasional low-tech camping trip. I have to plan articles in advance and carve out time in my schedule for production.</p>
<p>At times my forgetfulness means this time is after midnight because I elected to see a movie with friends or sleep on a plane rather than write. But I <em>always</em> set the time aside; even when it hurts.</p>
<p>Failing to set time aside for an objective means you don't take it seriously. If you don't take your goal seriously, why would anyone else hold you to it? <em>You</em> are the first line of accountability. Stay true to yourself and your goals, and your friends, family, and colleagues will support and encourage you as you work towards them.</p>
