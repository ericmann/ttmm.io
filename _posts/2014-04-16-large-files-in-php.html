excerpt: What if a visitor uploads a file that's too large for your system to handle?
---
<p>Whenever you allow the public to upload files to your site, you're opening a Pandora's Box of potential issues.</p>
<p>What if they upload a file format you don't want on your server?</p>
<p>What if they upload a file with an incorrect extension?</p>
<p>What if they upload a file that's too large for your system to handle?</p>
<p>As it turns out, the third issue is relatively straight-forward to fix.</p>
<h2>Before the fix</h2>
<p>Let's say your upload form initially consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The form itself, correctly set up with [cci]enctype="multipart/form-data"[/cci] and pointing its action at your server</li>
<li>A file input field</li>
<li>A hidden "action" input field to enable server-side filtering</li>
</ul>
<p>When the file gets to the server, your code checks for the presence of the action flag and changes its logic (i.e. begins processing the form), and moves merrily along.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if the file uploaded is larger than your server can handle, madness will ensue instead.  The action flag <em>won't</em> be hit and either the page acts as if nothing's been submitted or, worse, your customer is left with a white-page-of-death.</p>
<p>Not sure which of the two doom-and-gloom eventualities plague your site?  Check your server's [cci]php.ini[/cci] file for the [cci]post_max_size[/cci] definition, then try submitting a file larger than that value.  It will fail in a ball of fiery glory.</p>
<h2>After the fix</h2>
<p>When a PHP request exceeds the [cci]post_max_size[/cci] setting, the server will <a title="Description of core php.ini directives" href="http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size">automatically empty</a> the contents of both [cci]$_POST[/cci] and [cci]$_FILE[/cci].  So if you're keying application logic based on flags set in [cci]$_POST[/cci] variables, it will fail miserably.</p>
<p>The fix is relatively simple.</p>
<p>Add whatever flags you'll need in the [cci]$_POST[/cci] object as query arguments on your form's action attribute.  This will submit them as <em>both</em> POST (assuming they're still in hidden input fields) <em>and</em> GET parameters.</p>
<p>Now switch your application logic to check for [cci]$_REQUEST[/cci] flags, and it will appropriately check the GET parameters, see the flags, and continue along.</p>
<p>Further, you can check if both the action flag is set and the [cci]$_POST[/cci] array is empty to determine if you're experiencing an error condition and alert your site visitors.  It makes for a much more robust user experience, and prevents <em>anyone</em> from claiming your site is broken because they tried to upload something larger than you expected.</p>
