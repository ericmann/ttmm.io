<p>"No, I won't pay for that conference. I don't see any value there, and I'd rather you not lose productivity here."</p>
<p>The first time I asked a supervisor for permission to attend a community WordCamp, things didn't go so well. I ended up taking vacation time so I could attend anyway, and convinced another organization in the community to help pay my way. My boss at the time couldn't justify spending $300 on airfare, booking a hotel, and giving me a day off to attend ... a $25 conference.</p>
<p>WordCamps are well-known for being inexpensive events. They specifically target members of the local WordPress community and keep costs low (through sponsorships) so <em>anyone </em>can attend.</p>
<p>As a result, the pool of regular speakers is somewhat smaller than other industries since there's no chance the conference itself can afford to bring in sponsors from out of town.</p>
<h2>Other Industries</h2>
<p>Most of the WordPress developers I know have come up through the ranks of open source. They're self-taught, worked hard as freelancers, and eventually landed a career or partnership with a larger organization. Occasionally, I see someone "graduate" from WordPress to an organization rooted in more "traditional" software development.</p>
<p>Believe me or not, but there's a very clear separation between WordPress and <em>every other software community out there</em>.</p>
<p>I did things the other way around, though. I started in a more traditional role working with .Net development at first one, then another, then a third software firm. I also had the opportunity to attend a few conferences in that space, both as an attendee <em>and</em> as a speaker.</p>
<p>As an attendee, I was faced with ticket prices from $300 to $1300 for a 1-2 day conference. Speakers were world class, the venues were professional convention centers, and the after parties included raffles for not one but up to <em>ten</em> brand new ThinkPad laptops.</p>
<p>One conference even awarded <em>every single attendee</em> a new Xbox 360 so they could use the new software and development tools Microsoft had presented during one of the lunch breaks.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I've seen at a WordCamp: individual sponsors giving away <em>an</em> iPad.</p>
<h2>WordPress Comes of Age</h2>
<p>Early in my career, when I explained that I wrote networking software in .Net, they were impressed. When I mentioned my Azure-hosted networks, they asked for details and my card. When I made recommendations about network security, they listened.</p>
<p>When I tell people today I work with WordPress, they smile, nod, and give me a patronizing "hmm." Worse, a few people comment about how their teenage nephew/daughter/neighbor "does that too."</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/williamsba/status/531210414055759873</p>
<p>I <a title="Digital Detox" href="https://eamann.com/faith/digital-detox/">took October off</a> of social networking, so I entirely missed the announcements of <a title="LoopConf" href="http://loopconf.io/">LoopConf</a>. Seeing the backlash against the conference's pricing has me worried, though.</p>
<p>Firstly, we're software developers. Our time isn't cheap. If you have a billable rate of $200[ref]If you aren't charging this much for your time, please smack yourself now and consider raising your prices.[/ref] then this is 3-4 hours of billable work. Yes, that's billable labor with fruit you can't apply to the mortgage, but it's a significant investment in your business and in the <em>industry</em> of WordPress itself.</p>
<p>Will everyone be able to afford this? No.</p>
<p>Will the higher price make the conference more meaningful to those who attend? Absolutely.</p>
<p>When you spend $25-40 on a WordCamp, it's easy to write off a few sessions for the sake of networking. The number of times I've skipped a session here or there to engage in longer conversations with other attendees is staggering. The number of times I've seen <em>others</em> stop paying attention at a (cheap) WordCamp to blog, hack, or <a title="Don’t be that guy: A Lesson in Conference Etiquette" href="https://eamann.com/tech/conference-ettiquite/">play World of Warcraft</a> out of boredom is equally staggering.</p>
<p>LoopConf's higher prices mean WordPress is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finally coming of age in an already-established industry of <em>professional</em> software tools</li>
<li>Forcing potential attendees to truly invest in the conference, their contribution to that conference, and the gains the expect to get from the conference</li>
</ol>
<p>LoopConf will be expensive. It's also exactly what we need in the WordPress community right now.</p>
