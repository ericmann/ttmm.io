<p>I'm a huge proponent of working <a title="Network Dependency" href="http://eamann.com/tech/network-dependency/">unplugged</a>. I use Vagrant for my local development environment, which gives me the ability to work without running either a remote server or (usually) a network connection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've discovered that many of the tools and tricks we're using to optimize websites are making it impossible to work truly offline.</p>
<h2>Network Dependency</h2>
<p>We had some network issues during WordCamp Romania which rendered the Internet inaccessible to my machine for a number of hours. When I tried to take advantage of some downtime to hack on code, I realized a significant issue:</p>
<p>Even on my local system, WordPress was requesting a <em>ginormous</em>[ref]Technical term. Look it up.[/ref] number of external resources. Both the front-end and the admin would sit and spin for up to 10 minutes before the remote requests all timed out and the page loaded.</p>
<p>I quickly realized that, even though I used a local Vagrant box for development, my local development was <em>still</em> dependent on an active network for some sites.</p>
<h2>The Offenders</h2>
<p>Every image loaded through a CDN fails when running things locally. Every script include from sources like Google fail to download. Any UI logic that depends on the callbacks triggered by these scripts fails.</p>
<p>Advertising fails. User tracking fails. Social network integrations fail. <a title="Server-Side Device Detection With JavaScript" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/01/server-side-device-detection-with-javascript/">Server-side device optimizations</a> fail.</p>
<p>The majority of the tricks we use to load a site quickly - offloading assets to a CDN, lazy-loading scripts based on the callbacks fired by other scripts, etc - fail to take into account what happens when a site is partially offline. Sure, your visitor will likely not run into this problem, but there are situations that resemble working locally.</p>
<p>I once had a major client experience massive outages from <em>just</em> their CDN. Accessing the main site worked fine, but the DNS mappings for their CDN domains were broken so a total of zero assets loaded on their site. It was a horrible experience.</p>
<h2>A Way Forward</h2>
<p>The first tool I turned to in attempts to combat this problem is the <a title="Airplane Mode" href="https://github.com/norcross/airplane-mode">Airplane Mode plugin</a> for WordPress by <a title="Andrew Norcross" href="https://twitter.com/norcross">Andrew Norcross</a>. It's a fantastic plugin, but only helps with the <em>serve</em><em>r</em> side. The project I was working with uses several cron jobs to sync remote data, and this plugin was invaluable to cleaning up PHP processes on the back-end.</p>
<p>But the front end is still pulling in remote scripts/images/assets that are inaccessible over a compromised network.</p>
<p>Projects like <a title="Hoodie" href="http://hood.ie/">Hoodie</a> help promote an offline-first development experience by syncing data to local storage so there's no UX interruption. Unfortunately, this tool only addresses <em>data</em>, not things like script and image tags and asynchronous operations.</p>
<p>Is there a way forward? Likely, but it will probably take the format of a browser plugin that detects network outages and responds with similar or cached versions of the unavailable scripts. If such a tool existed, <em>true</em> offline development would be possible - though it would come with its own set of design challenges.</p>
