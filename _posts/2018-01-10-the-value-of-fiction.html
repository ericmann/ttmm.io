excerpt: There's inherent value in stories that are entirely made up. Part of the
  magic is that they can be subtle wrappers around tricky issues - it's easier to
  discuss a sensitive topic when done within the context of an alien civilization.

<p>I read a lot. By &quot;a lot&quot; I mean I read over 50 books in 2017. Some was fiction, some was non fiction, but all of it was enjoyable.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Every time I plow through a new book series, people stop to ask me <em>why</em>﻿ I bother with it at all. I read a fair amount of technical books, but I love to spend my time reading through various fiction stories as well. It&#x27;s a bit of an escape for me, but definitely serves a greater purpose as well.</p>

<h2>Fiction as an Analog</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:core/heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Almost everyone loves <em>Star Wars</em>. It&#x27;s a great story that covers everything from action to philosophy to the hero&#x27;s journey, with even a bit of romance thrown in. The original trilogy was groundbreaking filmmaking and has shaped the way many of us view movies ever since.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>But one of the more brilliant elements of Star Wars was how it could be somewhat critical of world events without explicitly referencing world events.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>The original trilogy features the evil Empire and their armies of stormtroopers bent on dominating the galaxy under a ruthless dictatorship. Without giving too much away for those who live under rocks and haven&#x27;t seen it, when the Empire falls, we&#x27;re left with a galaxy at peace for long into the future.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Until <em>The Force Awakens</em>, when we discover a new group has risen from the ashes of the Empire and is resurrecting the old ways to once again dominate the galaxy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Consider that the Empire was less-than-loosely based on the history of Nazi Germany. Now consider what it would look like to have a new generation of people trying to follow in the footsteps of a defunct, evil dictatorship. Taking on their imagery, their names, their slogans, and trying to convince the world that said dictatorship was <em>right</em>﻿ in their worldview. <em>That</em>﻿ is the story of the new trilogy&#x27;s &quot;First Order.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>And it&#x27;s remarkably similar to contemporary veins of neo-fascists we&#x27;re confronting in the real world today. Except, if you talk about current events, you&#x27;ll likely end up in an argument. If you talk about <em>Star Wars</em>, well, you might still end up arguing, but about porgs rather than which side is the bad guys.</p>

<h2>Creative Expansion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:core/heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>The value in having these somewhat abstracted conversations is that they stretch the bounds with which you can envision others&#x27; viewpoints. It&#x27;s one thing to ask you to think from the perspective of someone who disagrees with you about something specific - say politics. It&#x27;s another thing to try to describe the various leanings and motives of a political system you&#x27;re not even a part of.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2CLeQCE">A (non-fiction) book</a> I read a while back talked about this concept from the perspective of people studying religion. There are, ultimately, two groups: <strong>balconeers</strong> sitting in a balcony above a busy street and <strong>travelers</strong> walking on the street below.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>The balconeers can overhear everything the travelers talk about. They can observe their behavior and opine on what&#x27;s going on. They&#x27;re onlookers; completely separated from the action but with a high-level view of everything and, possibly, an objective opinion on various matters the travelers are experiencing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>The travelers, on the other hand, are right in the fray. They have to decide where to go and when, and that decision <em>matters</em> to them. It determines where they sleep, if they get lost, when they get to eat, etc. They&#x27;re intimately involved with a specific journey and can only see it from a subjective viewpoint.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>We&#x27;re all <em>travelers</em>﻿ in life. What we do, what we say, where we go - these all have ramifications for the outcomes of our lives. Fiction gives us the chance to be <em>balconners</em>﻿ observing someone else&#x27;s travel and taking a higher, more objective view of things.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>But the true value in fiction is when we draw parallels between the travelers in a story and ourselves as travelers in life. We can begin to apply the detached, objective view we gained as an onlooker to a more involved, subjective situation in our day-to-day.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Creative fiction gives us the ability to expand the conversation and view situations from viewpoints that would otherwise have been hidden from us. It&#x27;s a <em>very</em>﻿ valuable tool, and one I treasure.</p>
