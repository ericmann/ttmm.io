excerpt: Making an outrageous promise to lure in consumers is one thing - when they
  discover you lied, your brand equity and goodwill drops into the trash. Keeping
  that promise is something else entirely.

<p>Today, the labels that are popular among consumers are "all natural" or "organic." For the most part, they're buzzwords that don't mean much.</p>
<p>I've seen "all natural" products that still contain artificial ingredients as color or flavor stabilizers. I've seen "organic" products that fit the <em>legal</em> definition required to be labelled as such, but which fall short of what consumers actually expect out of those products.</p>
<p>In Oregon, we even have a measure on the ballot proposing label requirements for genetically-modified products, with all of the consuming legal half-speak that comes with such a law.</p>
<p>So when I saw this post by a friend of mine on Twitter, I was not at all surprised:</p>

<h2>Keep Your Outrageous Promises</h2>
<p>I recognize this bag of chips. I can tell you with certainty that I have actually purchased it before. I purchased it not just because I like the taste of the chips, but because I believed the promise that their packaging was 100% compostable. I even discarded the empty package into a compost bin.</p>
<p>It's probably still there.</p>
<p>Making an outrageous promise to lure in consumers is one thing - when they discover you lied, your brand equity and goodwill drops into the trash. <em>Keeping</em> that promise is something else entirely.</p>
<p>In business school, we studied the development of the <a title="Icebreaker" href="http://us.icebreaker.com/">Icebreaker</a> brand. I absolutely love outdoors-related companies, and those with compelling origin stories are even more enticing.</p>
<p>Icebreaker makes amazing wool clothing, and they emphasize the renewable nature of their products, the comfort of the materials, and the all-natural construction. They even explain that their clothing is <em>compostable</em>; unlike Sun Chips, Icebreaker puts their money where their mouth is and proves it.</p>

<p>As a business, keeping the promises you make (or purport to make) to consumers is vital to building and maintaining your reputation. Transparency and honesty <em>directly</em> affects your bottom line - with other players in the market, customers will turn to businesses they trust even if you have a superior/cheaper/newer product when they can't trust you.</p>
<p>The bottom line: if you make outrageous promises to attract customer attention, do you actually keep them?</p>
