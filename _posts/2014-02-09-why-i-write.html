excerpt: I have no less than 5 unfinished novels in my Dropbox.  They're all fun stories,
  and if you ever want to hear what they're about I'll tell you.  But you'll likely
  never see them on Amazon.  Why, then, do I bother to write?

<p>I love to read.</p>
<p>As a kid, I used to bike to the library every other day.  I'd check out my maximum of 3 books at a time, bike home, and dig right in.</p>
<p>Mystery novels.  Horror stories.  Historical biographies.  Speculative and experimental fiction.  I couldn't get enough.</p>
<p>Powell's, the local bookstore, held occasional book signings with popular autographs.  I went to one a month, collecting mountains of autographed tomes and bolstering my love for the written word.</p>
<p>One day, in high school, I finally decided I wanted to be a writer.  I mentioned it to my parents, my friends, my teachers.  I started adding "publish a novel" to my bucket and new years' resolutions lists.</p>
<h2>Writing is Hard</h2>
<p>I have no less than 5 unfinished novels in my Dropbox.  They're all fun stories, and if you ever want to hear what they're about I'll tell you.</p>
<p>But when it comes to storytelling, I can get a bit distracted.  I can type quickly, but not nearly as fast as I think.  As a result, I've usually burned through a particular story at least 10 times before I finish typing the first half - and my brain has moved on to something newer and more exciting.</p>
<p>In college, I met an amazing writer in my freshman dorm.  She was incredibly talented and wrote hundreds of pages of fan fiction in the universe of a series we both enjoyed.  Like me, she wanted to be a writer - unlike me, she was <em>actually</em> writing.</p>
<p>When she suggested I try <a title="NaNoWriMo" href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> one year to get started, I signed right up - and wrote 200 words total during the month of November.</p>
<p>A few years later, I started a publishing company to make good on a promise I'd made to <a title="The Indefatigable Wright Brothers" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C1RRXC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008C1RRXC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mindshmarket-20">publish her first book</a>.  I've now published four books by three separate authors.</p>
<p>I have yet to finish one of my own.</p>
<h2>Democratizing Publishing</h2>
<p>I got involved in WordPress originally because of its promise to "democratize publishing."  Honestly, I'm still not quite sure what the rest of the community means by that - or if we're living up to that ideal - but it still appeals to me.</p>
<p>I work on software that lets anyone publish their work online, quickly, without needing to learn how to hack code, set up a server, or seek out a medium through which to publish.  I <a title="Daily Dogfooding" href="http://eamann.com/tech/daily-dogfooding/">use the software daily</a> so I can understand the pains people go through using it.</p>
<p>This also means I'm producing <em>a lot</em> of written content.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I wanted to be a writer.  I wanted to be a writer because I loved books and, eventually, began to run out of the kind of things I wanted to read.</p>
<p>I wanted to become a writer so I could produce content for people like me.  So I could write things I would enjoy.  So I could, one day, meet someone who'd read and enjoyed my work and be able to have a conversation about how <em>they</em> felt about it.</p>
<p>I <em>became</em> a writer so I could join the conversation.  How about you?</p>
