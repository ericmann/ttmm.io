<p>This is less a proposal for a new feature, and more a discussion about a drastically lacking capability in WordPress.</p>
<p>It's not portable.</p>
<h2>WordPress Export/Import</h2>
<p>WordPress ships with the ability to <a title="Tools Export Screen" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Tools_Export_Screen">export content in XML format</a> (using a WordPress-specific format called WXR).  This is great for a quick backup, but ultimately lacks what many publishers are expecting out of a "portable" application.</p>
<p>The WXR file contains insufficient information to recreate a site from scratch.  Among the most important elements missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>User meta information (including hashed passwords) - users must be entirely recreated on the target site</li>
<li>Attachments - media can be downloaded and imported into the new site only if the original site is still online and the media is accessible</li>
<li>Site settings - tagline, comment/pingback settings, timezone configuration, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite lacking some vital information, WXR files often grow large as a site continues to build up content.  Unfortunately, this often means an export is too big to be safely imported to its new home.</p>
<p>Developers have even built <a title="WordPress WXR File Splitter (RSS XML)" href="http://www.rangerpretzel.com/content/view/20/1/">WXR file splitters</a> to help break things down a bit.  The tools are nifty, but that they're necessary shows we have a problem.</p>
<h2>Database Dumps</h2>
<p>More and more frequently, I find myself turning to lower level database tools to facilitate a large migration.</p>
<p>I'll use [cci]mysqldump[/cci] to export the database, copy it to the target server, then use MySQL's command line tools to re-import the same database.  After that, some magic with <a title="WP CLI" href="http://wp-cli.org/">WP-CLI</a> lets me replace any broken strings (i.e. changed domains) in the database without forcing me to do it by hand.</p>
<p>This process is much quicker than chunking a WXR file, importing chunks one at a time, and manually updating settings and other missing data.  But it's still inefficient.</p>
<p>Some sites have relatively small databases - with data dumps consisting of only a few MBs of data.  Other sites have much larger systems - with data dumps <em>starting</em> at 1.5GB.  It's one thing to keep this much data in a database; it's another to use it for a migration (or work to verify the integrity of the data once it's made it across the wire).</p>
<h2>An Ideal World</h2>
<p>I love the fact that MySQL makes data retrieval quick and helps optimize searching for and working with individual objects within the database.  I hate the fact that MySQL makes it so difficult to move content from one server to another.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, WordPress would be decoupled from its data store - allowing me to swap out MySQL for, say, flat-file YAML documents for data storage.  Being able to work with multiple data systems would enable site administrators to dump their content from one format to another and back again <em>losslessly</em>.</p>
<p>WXRs are lossy - they omit some important information.  MySQL dumps aren't lossy, but are too rigid - you can only map MySQL to MySQL, and only if you have direct DB access.[ref]If you've ever tried to copy-paste a large database dump into phpMyAdmin, you know <em>exactly</em> what I'm talking about.[/ref]</p>
<p>I would love the ability to, with a click, dump my entire site to a set of somewhat human-readable flat-files.  I would love even more to use those same flat-files to dynamically recreate <em>my entire site</em> on another server with no loss in data.</p>
<p>If and when WordPress reaches this state, the product (and the content it helps maintain) will be truly portable.</p>
