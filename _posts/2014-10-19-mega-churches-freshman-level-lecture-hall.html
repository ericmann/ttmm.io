  This isn't a good thing ...

<p>I was very proud to go to a large college. I had been somewhat antisocial in high school, so college was my opportunity to turn things around and meet a lot of people quickly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a large college often means freshman-level classes are equally large.</p>
<p>Often, introductory-level classes have several hundred to a thousand students. Lecture halls are enormous, and no one usually gets direct access to the professor - there are often teaching aides who fill office hours instead. If you want to dive deeper into the content, you instead ask a TA or create a study group that meets outside of class to study the content further.</p>
<p>It's this experience in particular that drove my brother to attend a far smaller school. Even introductory classes were limited in size, presenting direct access to the subject matter expert if you have questions.</p>
<p>I see these patterns somewhere outside academia, too.</p>
<h2>The Church</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, America has witnessed the rise of the mega church. Congregations of, at most, a few hundred tightly-knit individuals have gradually been replaced by bodies of several thousand believers, many who attend church just for the worship and sermon and never meet their fellow attendees.</p>
<p>The sermons are fantastic, impactful, and inspiring. The worship services are amazing and moving. But the fact that we worship and learn in an audience ofÂ <em>thousands</em> with little deeper connection to the material feels very much like Christianity 101 would at a large university.</p>
<p>Home churches and small groups likewise feel very much like the study groups we used to form freshman year to muddle through introductory chemistry without the professor.</p>
<p>What, then, would a 400-level church look like? In academia, this is a small group of people being led and taught by a qualified subject matter expert. How would we replicate this within the Church?</p>
