excerpt: Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to chat with some incredible people
  around the WP Watercooler. We were talking about strategies for writing/blogging
  more in 2014, and I wanted to further explain one strategy I particularly enjoy
  (and plan to implement this year).

<p>Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to chat with some incredible people around the <a title="WP Watercooler Episode 68" href="http://www.wpwatercooler.com/video/ep68-strategies-blogging-one-four-wpwatercooler-dec-30-2013/">WP Watercooler</a>. We were talking about strategies for writing/blogging more in 2014, and I wanted to further explain one strategy I particularly enjoy (and plan to implement this year).</p>
<p><strong>Don't send 1-off emails.</strong></p>
<p>While this obviously doesn't apply to client work, it can apply to the majority of contact-form submissions many of us receive.  "How do I do X in WordPress?"  "What advice do you have for someone doing Y?"  These are usually generic questions that will inevitably come up more than once - so why not write a blog post instead of responding to email?</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of Scott Hanselman's writing; one of my favorite of his posts is <a title="Do they deserve the gift of your keystrokes?" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoTheyDeserveTheGiftOfYourKeystrokes.aspx">one about keystrokes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let break it down. I'm 36 and change. I'll live to be 80, let's say, and I can type 100 words a minute (but 50 of that is errors and the backspace key) so let's say 50WPM. If I type for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year, for the next 44 years, that means there are 198M keystrokes left in my hands. Max. Period. And that's generous; it's likely 10% of that.</p>
<p>Let's assume the average length of an English word is 5, plus a space, so six. That's a ceiling of 168M more words I can type in my lifetime. Nothing I can do, short of dictation, or some new brain invention is going to create more keystrokes. I am I/O bound by my hands. The keystrokes they contain are finite. And this assuming my hands don't give out.</p>
<p>Drink that in. OK. So now, next time someone emails you ask yourself "is emailing this person back the best use of my remaining keystrokes?" That includes both 1:1 and 1:many emails. You could even add a little hubris to it and say: "Does this person deserve the gift of my keystrokes?"</p>
<p>Instead, consider writing a blog post or adding to a wiki with your keystrokes, then emailing the link to the original emailer.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've participated in <a title="National Novel Writing Month" href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> for more than a few years now, so I have a pretty good idea of what it means to sit and write an obscene number of words in a day.  As much as I enjoy writing, typing nonstop for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year for the rest of my life seems ... painful.  Let's assume Scott's "likely 10% of that holds" and we're down from 168M words to ~17M words.</p>
<p>A NaNoWriMo novel is at least 50,000 words, so this means I'm limited to writing no more than 340 NaNoWriMo-length works in my lifetime.  Writing only one book a year, and I'd live to be legendary!  Factor in all of the code I write, the emails I write, the blog posts I write ... and that number is far less optimistic.</p>
<p>I once installed a keylogger on my machine for no other reason to see how many keystrokes I used in a day.  On a non-writing (coding) workday, I average 2-3k. On a writing (non-coding) non-workday, I average 8-10k.  Hopefully this means I'm just a faster typer than Scott.  But it still makes me second guess replying to every one-off "how do I" email I receive.</p>
<p>To blog more in 2014, I'm going to stop replying to these one-off emails entirely.  Instead, I will craft a response post and email the link[ref]If the topic is something of a private nature I will, of course, keep the response private as well. I'm referring specifically to "how do I approach this problem" emails.  I get 2-3 of those a week.[/ref].  Would your blog (and inbox) benefit from this strategy as well?</p>
