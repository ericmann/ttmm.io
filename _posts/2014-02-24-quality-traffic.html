<p>This year, I've set a personal goal to increase traffic on this site.</p>
<p>Not so I can sell advertising.  Not so I can brag about my visitor count.  I'm trying to build a platform upon which I can amplify my voice and share stories about which I'm passionate.</p>
<p>As a result, I've begun to look at my viewership statistics in a way I never before imagined.</p>
<h2>Hacker News</h2>
<p>Often, I'll submit my more technically-minded articles to Hacker News.  It helps me see discussions in new ways, but rarely leads to meaningful traffic.</p>
<p>On rare occasion, one of my articles will become somewhat popular and make it to the front page.  This means a huge spike in concurrent traffic for me, and a wonderful way for the WP Engine team to prove the stability of their hosting platform.</p>
<p>Despite grabbing 10k views in a day, though, these Hacker News spikes rarely - if ever - yield anything beyond mild entertainment for my afternoon.  The traffic wanes just as quickly as it appeared, and my viewership settles back on normal levels.</p>
<h2>Real Traffic</h2>
<p>My objective is not to gather high-numbers of one-off readers.  That, ironically, would be easy.</p>
<p>My objective is to gain <em>real</em><em> viewers</em>.  Repeat readers who not only check back frequently, but who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscribe</li>
<li>Comment on my articles</li>
<li>Share content with their peers</li>
</ul>
<p>On a good day, my site averages 300-400 unique viewers.  A popular post (excluding those gone "viral" on Hacker News) will pull in 1000-1200 uniques. On the other hand, I have fewer than 10 articles with more than 10 comments from readers.</p>
<p>While I might be bringing in readers, they're <em>passive</em> and my target is a much more <em>active</em> demographic.</p>
<p>So, while I continue to flesh out content on technology (WordPress, JavaScript, server configuration, etc), business development (marketing, communications strategy, etc), and my faith, I want to push back on you for feedback.</p>
<p><strong>What about a blog post makes you feel strongly enough to leave a comment?</strong></p>
<p>If you're reading this, you're probably in my target reader group.  If you have left a comment previously, you're <em>definitely</em> in that group.  So, unscientifically, what prompts you to leave a comment and engage in the conversation?</p>
