<p>New Year&#x27;s is an opportunity to stop, take stock, and reflect on everything we&#x27;ve done in the past year. While it&#x27;s usually a good idea to do this <em>more often</em>﻿ than once a year, the seasonal holiday presents an opportune moment for the too-busy-to-otherwise-schedule-things.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>I fall into that category.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Today begins a new <em>annual</em>﻿ tradition of recounting the successes and losses of the prior year and setting clear, <em>actionable</em>﻿ goals for the year to come.</p>

<h2>2017 in Review</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:core/heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>It&#x27;s common to spend New Year&#x27;s lamenting how horrible the previous year has been; this might be a recent occurrence, but it&#x27;s also increasing in frequency. In hindsight, however, I&#x27;m pretty happy about my 2017.</p>

<h3>The Ups</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:core/heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>This past year saw me speak at several conferences. From Florida to Portland to Washington, D.C. I spent time teaching, learning from, meeting, and building friendships with some truly great people!</p>

<p>Summer saw the arrival of our daughter. She&#x27;s an absolute delight and I love learning more about her personality each and every day. Having a little one in the house reenforces so many of my personal goals for self growth - now it&#x27;s not just my own <em>ego</em> that depends on my doing what I say I&#x27;ll do!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>2017 also saw me become a regular contributor to <a href="https://www.phparch.com/magazine/">php[architect] magazine</a>, writing the monthly Security Corner column. This year I also wrote and <a href="https://www.phparch.com/books/security-principles-for-php-applications/">published my first book</a>, a handbook covering all things related to PHP application security.</p>

<p>Back in the personal realm, 2017 saw me continuing down the path of custom building furniture for our home. After finishing a coffee table in 2016, I made two custom end tables and <a href="https://twitter.com/EricMann/status/884134165645467653">a rocking chair</a> in 2017!</p>

<p>I&#x27;m another year older, have a few extra line items for my resume, and hopefully have picked up some deeper levels of wisdom and knowledge along the way.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/heading --></p>
<h3>The Downs</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:core/heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Like many people, my year wasn&#x27;t all smiles. I lost family. I lost friends. I gained more than a few gray hairs worrying about the future of my community and nation.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>Each of these is a lesson learned. Never a regret. Life is too short and moves too quickly to waste time on regrets.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/heading --></p>
<h2>The Year to Come</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:core/heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>I typically set myself a small handful private milestones to achieve each year. By &quot;small handful&quot; I mean a bulleted list on a Post-It note. This year is no different.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>By the close of 2018,  I will:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Master a new software technology related to machine learning (currently studying TensorFlow)</li>
<li>Run a half marathon (I&#x27;ve run 3 full marathons already, but I need to get back into this. I have two tentative races on the calendar)</li>
<li>Start a new business (Paperwork is filed and the domain is purchased. I&#x27;m putting the time in to get things off the ground within the next month or two)</li>
<li>Write a book on secure application design (Currently whiteboarding topics and potential outlines)</li>
<li>Take the family on a fun, memorable vacation (Planning something for later in the summer/fall)</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:core/list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>
<p>What&#x27;s on your list? What steps are you taking <em>right now</em>﻿ to move closer to accomplishing it?</p>
