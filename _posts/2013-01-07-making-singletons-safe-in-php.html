  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: Singletons are not inherently evil; just overused and implemented
    poorly. Here's a way Singletons can be perfectly safe to use in PHP.

    Singletons Safe in PHP\";s:11:\"description\";s:134:\"Singletons are not inherently
    evil; just overused and implemented poorly. Here's a way Singletons can be perfectly
    safe to use in PHP.\";s:7:\"content\";s:12968:\"<a title=\"The Case for Singletons
    in WordPress\" href=\"http://eamann.com/tech/the-case-for-singletons/\">Last time</a>,
    I argued in favor of the Singleton pattern in WordPress.  Singletons make sense
    in WordPress specifically for several reasons:\n<ul>\n\t<li>They live in the global
    scope without using the already abused/overused [cci]global[/cci] keyword</li>\n\t<li>As
    a distributed application maintained by several hundred developers, they prevent
    problems that likely arise from others misusing your code</li>\n</ul>\nBut one
    of the goals of object-oriented software development is to make your code reusable.
     The Singleton pattern as I explained it last time isn't really applicable outside
    of WordPress.  Typically, Singletons <em>are</em> a really bad idea.  But rather
    than get hung up on the term and settle for the knee-jerk \"it's bad, don't use
    it\" conclusion, let's take a deeper look.  There's a reason Singletons exist;
    they solve a specific problem.  So rather than reject them out of hand, let's
    make a minor change to make them safe for general PHP use.\n\nThere were two major
    arguments <em>against</em> Singletons throughout the comments, Twitter posts,
    <a title=\"The Case for Singletons | Hacker News\" href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4978365\">Y
    Combinator thread</a>, and private emails that followed my last post. First, that
    Singletons introduce hidden dependencies in your code.  Second, that Singletons
    are nearly impossible to unit test.  Both of these arguments are valid, but I
    have counters to each.\n<h2>Hidden Dependencies</h2>\nAny parameters a function
    accepts are visible dependencies. But if the function requires something else
    to operate - i.e. an open database connection - that is referenced through a global
    variable rather than a parameter, <a href=\"http://tutorials.jenkov.com/ood/understanding-dependencies.html#visiblehidden\"
    title=\"Understanding Dependencies\">that dependency is considered <em>hidden</em></a>.
    There is no way for a third party to know about that functional dependency without
    actually viewing the implementation of the function. Hidden dependencies make
    it extremely difficult to code against an API because the API isn't the whole
    story.\n\nAs an application grows, it's easier and easier to take shortcuts to
    get things done.  WordPress, for example, [cci]global[/cci]izes many of its internal
    variables.  The entire <a title=\"The Loop | WordPress Codex\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop\">post
    loop</a> is set up specifically to abuse the fact that the [cci]$post[/cci] object
    is global:\n\n<code lang=\"php\">if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() )
    :\n  the_post(); // Populates global $post object\n\n  // Filter and echo $post->post_title
    from the global $post\n  the_title();\n\n  // Filter and echos $post->post_content
    from the global $post\n  the_content();\n\nendwhile; endif;</code>\n\nTo get around
    this hidden dependency, you <a title=\"Dependency Injection\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\">inject</a>
    it.  Rather than referencing the global post object inside the function (a hidden
    dependency that you can't easily override at runtime), you pass a post object
    when you call the function.  This post object can then be substituted with another
    at runtime and the code is none the wiser.\n\n<code lang=\"php\">// So instead
    of this function\nfunction do_something_to_post() {\n  global $post;\n\n  $post->post_content
    = apply_filters( 'modify_content', $post->post_content );\n\n  return $post;\n}\n\n//
    You'd use this function and pass $post with the call.\nfunction do_something_to_post(
    $post ) {\n  $post->post_content = apply_filters( 'modify_content', $post->post_content
    );\n\n  return $post;\n}</code>\n\nYour business logic shouldn't ever have to
    know where the post object comes from, just what it looks like.  Abstract that
    functionality away and you can provide any object you want - a post pulled from
    the database, one parsed from a document in the file system, or one hard-coded
    in a unit testing framework.\n\n<h3>In Singletons</h3>\n\nWhen developers use
    Singletons, they're often tempted to reference [cci]Singleton::get_instance()[/cci]
    directly (which is akin to invoking a global variable).  Instead, code should
    accept a parameter and expect it to have a particular signature.  In strictly
    typed languages like C and C#, you'd do this by specifying an interface the object
    is required to implement.\n\nDynamically typed languages like PHP don't require
    that[ref]Omitting type references in PHP is often considered \"duck typing.\"
    \ Basically, \"if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's a duck.\"  So
    if the object passed in implements the methods you plan to use, it might as well
    be of the type you expected ... even if it's something else.  A function can accept
    an array, but I can just as easily pass it an object that implements [cci]ArrayAccess[/cci]
    and the function doesn't know the difference.[/ref], but it's a good idea to get
    in the habit anyway.  It makes your intention clear to other developers and makes
    your code - and its dependencies - self-documenting.  Instead of invoking our
    Singleton object <em>inside</em> the function, we pass in an object that implements
    the same interface as our Singleton:\n\n<code lang=\"php\">function save_data(
    IDatabase $db_connection ) {\n  // The IDatabase interface specifies a persist()
    method. We don't\n  // care what the object that gets passed in is, so long as
    it\n  // conforms to the interface we expect to use.\n  $db_connection->persist();\n}\n$connection
    = DB::get_instance();\n\nsave_data( $connection );</code>\n\nThe [cci]IDatabase[/cci]
    flag inside the function definition is what's called <a title=\"PHP: Type Hinting\"
    href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php\">Type Hinting</a>
    in PHP. It forces the passed parameter to be of the specified type - or for classes/interfaces
    to be a child or implementation of that type. It's not strictly required for dependency
    injection, but placing the type in the function call makes your intentions in
    the code crystal clear to the next developer who reads it.\n<h2>Unit Testing</h2>\nEvery
    unit test should start from a clean slate.  Ideally, unit test should run independent
    of the database and filesystem.  This is actually my biggest problem with WordPress
    - since so many of its DB calls are hard-coded in the application, the unit test
    suite <em>requires</em> a database in order to run.  Bad form.\n\nThe problem
    with Singletons as I explained them in my last article is a global state - once
    they're instantiated, they stick around.  Anything you do to a Singleton in one
    test is persisted and visible in other tests.  This global state makes testing
    a mess, and my (lazy) solution was to introduce a [cci]::reset()[/cci] method
    that flushed the stored instance between tests.\n\nThere's a better way.\n\nFirst,
    define the interface your Singleton object will implement.  This isn't a strict
    requirement, but it's easy for other developers to look at an interface and grok
    the API you're exposing.\n\nSecond, define an <em>abstract</em> class that implements
    this interface.  Don't actually include any abstract functionality (unless you
    really want to).  The point here is to have the business logic of your Singleton
    encapsulated in a way that can't be instantiated directly.\n\nFinally, define
    a Singleton class that <em>extends</em> the abstract business logic class.  The
    Singleton wraps things up in a nice, can-only-be-instantiated-once wrapper.\n\n<code
    lang=\"php\" height=\"790\">interface IDemo {\n  function write( $file, $message
    );\n\n  // These methods will be used to demonstrate state\n  function increment(
    $step );\n  function get_counter();\n}\n\nabstract class Abstract_Demo implements
    IDemo {\n  protected $counter = 0;\n\n  public function write( $file, $message
    ) {\n    $fp = fopen( $file, 'a' );\n\n    fwrite( $fp, $message . \"rn\" );\n\n
    \   fclose( $fp );\n  }\n\n  public function increment( $step ) {\n    $this->counter
    += $step;\n  }\n\n  public function get_counter() {\n    return $this->counter;\n
    \ }\n}\n\nfinal class Singleton_Demo extends Abstract_Demo {\n  private static
    $instance = null;\n\n  private function __construct() {}\n\n  public static function
    get_instance() {\n    if ( null == self::$instance ) {\n      self::$instance
    = new self;\n    }\n    return self::$instance;\n  }\n}\n\n$logger = Singleton_Demo::get_instance();\n$logger->write(
    'file.txt', 'This writes out to a file.' );</code>\n\nThe incredibly basic example
    above introduces an interface to document the signature of our class, an abstract
    class to implement the business logic, and a final class to instantiate that logic.
     As an abstract class cannot be directly instantiated, there's no danger of anyone
    doing so without going through our Singleton.  In our live application, the Singleton
    prevents any other developers from accidentally making more than one copy of our
    class.\n\nWhen it comes time to test, though, the unit test project can extend
    the class the same way the Singleton does, but with a public constructor.  Now,
    within our unit test suite, we can create a <em>new</em> instance of our class
    for every single test.\n\n<code lang=\"php\">class Concrete_Demo extends Abstract_Demo
    {\n  public function __construct() {}\n}\n\n$logger = new Test_Demo();\n$logger->write(

<p><a title="The Case for Singletons in WordPress" href="http://eamann.com/tech/the-case-for-singletons/">Last time</a>, I argued in favor of the Singleton pattern in WordPress. &nbsp;Singletons make sense in WordPress specifically for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They live in the global scope without using the already abused/overused [cci]global[/cci] keyword</li>
<li>As a distributed application maintained by several hundred developers, they prevent problems that likely arise from others misusing your code</li>
</ul>
<p>But one of the goals of object-oriented software development is to make your code reusable. &nbsp;The Singleton pattern as I explained it last time isn't really applicable outside of WordPress. &nbsp;Typically, Singletons&nbsp;<em>are</em> a really bad idea. &nbsp;But rather than get hung up on the term and settle for the knee-jerk "it's bad, don't use it" conclusion, let's take a deeper look. &nbsp;There's a reason Singletons exist; they solve a specific problem. &nbsp;So rather than reject them out of hand, let's make a minor change to make them safe for general PHP use.</p>
<p>There were two major arguments&nbsp;<em>against</em> Singletons throughout the comments, Twitter posts, <a title="The Case for Singletons | Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4978365">Y Combinator thread</a>, and private emails that followed my last post. First, that Singletons introduce hidden dependencies in your code. &nbsp;Second, that Singletons are nearly impossible to unit test. &nbsp;Both of these arguments are valid, but I have counters to each.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Hidden Dependencies</h2>
<p>Any parameters a function accepts are visible dependencies. But if the function requires something else to operate - i.e. an open database connection - that is referenced through a global variable rather than a parameter, <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/ood/understanding-dependencies.html#visiblehidden" title="Understanding Dependencies">that dependency is considered <em>hidden</em></a>. There is no way for a third-party to know about that functional dependency without actually viewing the implementation of the function. Hidden dependencies make it extremely difficult to code against an API because the API isn't the whole story.</p>
<p>As an application grows, it's easier and easier to take shortcuts to get things done. &nbsp;WordPress, for example, [cci]global[/cci]izes many of its internal variables. &nbsp;The entire <a title="The Loop | WordPress Codex" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop">post loop</a> is set up specifically to abuse the fact that the [cci]$post[/cci] object is global:</p>
<p><code lang="php">if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) :<br />
  the_post(); // Populates global $post object</p>
<p>  // Filter and echo $post->post_title from the global $post<br />
  the_title();</p>
<p>  // Filter and echos $post->post_content from the global $post<br />
  the_content();</p>
<p>endwhile; endif;</code></p>
<p>To get around this hidden dependency, you <a title="Dependency Injection" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">inject</a> it. &nbsp;Rather than referencing the global post object inside the function (a hidden dependency that you can't easily override at runtime), you pass a post object when you call the function. &nbsp;This post object can then be substituted with another at runtime and the code is none the wiser.</p>
<p><code lang="php">// So instead of this function<br />
function do_something_to_post() {<br />
  global $post;</p>
<p>  $post->post_content = apply_filters( 'modify_content', $post->post_content );</p>
<p>  return $post;<br />
}</p>
<p>// You'd use this function and pass $post with the call.<br />
function do_something_to_post( $post ) {<br />
  $post->post_content = apply_filters( 'modify_content', $post->post_content );</p>
<p>  return $post;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>Your business logic shouldn't ever have to know where the post object comes from, just what it looks like. &nbsp;Abstract that functionality away and you can provide any object you want - a post pulled from the database, one parsed from a document in the file system, or one hard-coded in a unit testing framework.</p>
<h3>In Singletons</h3>
<p>When developers use Singletons, they're often tempted to reference [cci]Singleton::get_instance()[/cci] directly (which is akin to invoking a global variable).  Instead, code should accept a parameter and expect it to have a particular signature. &nbsp;In strictly typed languages like C and C#, you'd do this by specifying an interface the object is required to implement.</p>
<p>Dynamically typed languages like PHP don't require that[ref]Omitting type references in PHP is often considered "duck typing."  Basically, "if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's a duck."  So if the object passed in implements the methods you plan to use, it might as well be of the type you expected ... even if it's something else.  A function can accept an array, but I can just as easily pass it an object that implements [cci]ArrayAccess[/cci] and the function doesn't know the difference.[/ref], but it's a good idea to get in the habit anyway. &nbsp;It makes your intention clear to other developers and makes your code - and its dependencies - self-documenting.  Instead of invoking our Singleton object <em>inside</em> the function, we pass in an object that implements the same interface as our Singleton:</p>
<p><code lang="php">function save_data( IDatabase $db_connection ) {<br />
  // The IDatabase interface specifies a persist() method. We don't<br />
  // care what the object that gets passed in is, so long as it<br />
  // conforms to the interface we expect to use.<br />
  $db_connection->persist();<br />
}<br />
$connection = DB::get_instance();</p>
<p>save_data( $connection );</code></p>
<p>The [cci]IDatabase[/cci] flag inside the function definition is what's called <a title="PHP: Type Hinting" href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php">Type Hinting</a> in PHP. It forces the passed parameter to be of the specified type - or for classes/interfaces to be a child or implementation of that type. It's not strictly required for dependency injection, but placing the type in the function call makes your intentions in the code crystal clear to the next developer who reads it.</p>
<h2>Unit Testing</h2>
<p>Every unit test should start from a clean slate. &nbsp;Ideally, unit test should run independent of the database and filesystem. &nbsp;This is actually my biggest problem with WordPress - since so many of its DB calls are hard-coded in the application, the unit test suite&nbsp;<em>requires</em> a database in order to run. &nbsp;Bad form.</p>
<p>The problem with Singletons as I explained them in my last article is a global state - once they're instantiated, they stick around. &nbsp;Anything you do to a Singleton in one test is persisted and visible in other tests. &nbsp;This global state makes testing a mess, and my (lazy) solution was to introduce a [cci]::reset()[/cci] method that flushed the stored instance between tests.</p>
<p>There's a better way.</p>
<p>First, define the interface your Singleton object will implement.  This isn't a strict requirement, but it's easy for other developers to look at an interface and grok the API you're exposing.</p>
<p>Second, define an <em>abstract</em> class that implements this interface.  Don't actually include any abstract functionality (unless you really want to).  The point here is to have the business logic of your Singleton encapsulated in a way that can't be instantiated directly.</p>
<p>Finally, define a Singleton class that <em>extends</em> the abstract business logic class.  The Singleton wraps things up in a nice, can-only-be-instantiated-once wrapper.</p>
<p><code lang="php">interface IDemo {<br />
  function write( $file, $message );</p>
<p>  // These methods will be used to demonstrate state<br />
  function increment( $step );<br />
  function get_counter();<br />
}</p>
<p>abstract class Abstract_Demo implements IDemo {<br />
  protected $counter = 0;</p>
<p>  public function write( $file, $message ) {<br />
    $fp = fopen( $file, 'a' );</p>
<p>    fwrite( $fp, $message . "\r\n" );</p>
<p>    fclose( $fp );<br />
  }</p>
<p>  public function increment( $step ) {<br />
    $this->counter += $step;<br />
  }</p>
<p>  public function get_counter() {<br />
    return $this->counter;<br />
  }<br />
}</p>
<p>final class Singleton_Demo extends Abstract_Demo {<br />
  private static $instance = null;</p>
<p>  private function __construct() {}</p>
<p>  public static function get_instance() {<br />
    if ( null == self::$instance ) {<br />
      self::$instance = new self;<br />
    }<br />
    return self::$instance;<br />
  }<br />
}</p>
<p>$logger = Singleton_Demo::get_instance();<br />
$logger->write( 'file.txt', 'This writes out to a file.' );</code></p>
<p>The incredibly basic example above introduces an interface to document the signature of our class, an abstract class to implement the business logic, and a final class to instantiate that logic. &nbsp;As an abstract class cannot be directly instantiated, there's no danger of anyone doing so without going through our Singleton. &nbsp;In our live application, the Singleton prevents any other developers from accidentally making more than one copy of our class.</p>
<p>When it comes time to test, though, the unit test project can extend the class the same way the Singleton does, but with a public constructor. &nbsp;Now, within our unit test suite, we can create a&nbsp;<em>new</em> instance of our class for every single test.</p>
<p><code lang="php">class Concrete_Demo extends Abstract_Demo {<br />
  public function __construct() {}<br />
}</p>
<p>$logger = new Test_Demo();<br />
$logger->write( 'file.txt', 'This also writes out.' );</code></p>
<p>Since our multiple-instance class implements the same interface as our Singleton, we can substitute it for our Singleton in whatever methods rely upon it.</p>
<p>Testing the business logic used by our Singleton is also fairly straight-forward using this concrete class.  Below is an example set of 4 unit tests.  The first two illustrate the conflict presented by testing Singletons - the state set up by the first test bleeds over into and corrupts the second.  The later two illustrate using a concrete extension of our abstract class to allow multiple-instantiation within our test suite.</p>
<p><code lang="php">class Demo_Test extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {<br />
  public function testSingletonDemo() {<br />
    $singleton = Singleton_Demo::get_instance();</p>
<p>    $this->assertEquals( 0, $singleton->get_counter() );</p>
<p>    $singleton->increment( 5 );</p>
<p>    $this->assertEquals( 5, $singleton->get_counter() );<br />
  }</p>
<p>  public function testSingletonDemoState() {<br />
    $singleton = Singleton_Demo::get_instance();</p>
<p>    // A new test should start with a new state. But since we<br />
    // manipulated our singleton in the last test, it already<br />
    // has an internal state. This test will FAIL if run after<br />
    // the preceding test. This illustrates why most developers<br />
    // hate Singletons.<br />
    $this->assertEquals( 0, $singleton->get_counter() );<br />
  }</p>
<p>  public function testConcreteDemo() {<br />
    $obj = new Concrete_Demo;</p>
<p>    $this->assertEquals( 0, $obj->get_counter() );</p>
<p>    $obj->increment( 5 );</p>
<p>    $this->assertEquals( 5, $obj->get_counter() );<br />
  }</p>
<p>  public function testConcreteDemoState() {<br />
    $obj = new Concrete_Demo;</p>
<p>    // We're testing a new instance, so the internal counter<br />
    // is once again set to 0.<br />
    $this->assertEquals( 0, $obj->get_counter() );<br />
  }<br />
}</p>
<p>// This class is included ONLY in the test suite. Not the live<br />
// application. That way it's never accidentally used.<br />
class Concrete_Demo extends Abstract_Demo {<br />
  public function __construct() {}<br />
