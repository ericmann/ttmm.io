  present, but because there's something cool I want to learn.

<p>I know several different people who learn in different ways.  I know auditory learners.  I know visual learners.  I know book learners.  I know kinesthetic learners.</p>
<p>I am none of the above.</p>
<h2>In College</h2>
<p>After I finished my undergraduate degree, I took a whole day of before I started graduate school - in an entirely unrelated field.  Many of my colleagues had bachelors' degrees in business, so I usually felt a bit behind in courses on macroeconomics and international finance.</p>
<p>I tried listening to extra lectures.  I tried reading supplementary materials.  I tried watching our professors' video recordings from other terms.  Nothing seemed to help.</p>
<p>Then a friend asked <em>me</em> to help her study for a test.</p>
<p>I didn't know the material very well, but I said "sure" anyway.  We sat down with a few other students in the library and I gave my first impromptu lesson on microeconomics.</p>
<p>I didn't know the material <em>at all</em> but was teaching it.  This is when I discovered that I learned best <em>by teaching</em>.</p>
<h2>Why I Speak</h2>
<p>I sign up to speak at conferences because it gives me the opportunity to <em>teach</em> something.  Since I learn best by teaching others, I sign up to speak at conferences because I have something I want to learn.</p>
<p>I want to learn about asynchronous JavaScript, so I prepare and present talks on the topic.  I want to better learn unit testing, so I prepare and present talks on the topic.  I want to learn more about business development, so I prepare and present talks on the topic.</p>
<p>If there's something I want to learn, I'll find a reason to go out, study up, and present it to someone else.</p>
<p>I speak at conferences not just because there's something cool I want to <em>present</em>, but because there's something cool I want to <em>learn</em>.</p>
<p>Why do <em>you</em> speak at conferences?</p>
