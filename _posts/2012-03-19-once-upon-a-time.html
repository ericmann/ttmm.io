<p>When I was 6, I wanted to be an architect.</p>
<p>I loved drawing, enjoyed visiting cool buildings, and had the odd drive to be a part of something bigger.  I checked books out from the library, talked up the idea with adults, and even took a crack at drawing up blueprints for the first house I'd build.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that didn't quite work out.</p>
<p>As I grew up, my interests changed.  I tried my hand at CAD in middle school, but couldn't figure out the complex interfaces.  Since everyone told me using a CAD system was essential for architecture, I gave up on that dream and grabbed hold of others.</p>
<p>My favorite high school teachers taught science, so I spent all of my time trying to figure out how the world worked.  Much to my parents' dismay, I even brought experiments home from time to time[ref]The first time I tried dividing water into hydrogen and oxygen in the living room resulted in several awkward parent-teacher meetings.[/ref].</p>
<p>Originally I wanted to work in the space program for NASA. I even applied for internships and chose a physics major in college for that purpose.  Eventually, I changed gears and wanted to teach.  Then I wanted to work in a lab.  Then I gave up on that entirely and went back to school for a second degree in political science.</p>
<p>I found I liked telling stories more than anything, so I studied marketing in business school and walked away with a masters degree in international management.</p>
<h2>Right Now</h2>
<p>At the moment, though, I'm not using any of my degrees.</p>
<p>I work full-time writing web software for the insurance industry.  I also freelance on the side, writing open source software for WordPress.  But while I enjoy both, neither is really my "dream job."</p>
<p>I come away from work somewhat burned out at the end of the day, only to keep working late into the night on the plethora of unfinished side-projects I have on my plate.  Client work.  <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/ericmann">My WordPress plugins</a>.  My marketing/publishing business.  <a title="Kickstarter Proposal" href="http://mindsharestrategy.com/2012/kickstarter-proposal/">My Kickstarter campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Like I said, I enjoy my work, I just don't necessarily feel this is where I'm supposed to be.[ref]I'm good at my job, I enjoy the satisfaction of finishing projects, and I love the challenge.  But I don't feel <em>called</em> to this particular field ... if that makes sense.[/ref]</p>
<p>So I've decided to make a list.  A list of the abstract <em>things</em> I love doing.  The things I'd love to do full-time if someone would pay me to do them.</p>
<h2>My List</h2>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>I'm a prolific reader.  So far in 2012 I've finished 16 separate books.  Novels, business books, technical guides.  You name it.  Every piece tells some kind of story, and I <em>live</em> for the story.</p>
<p>The best books, though, tell <em>peoples'</em> stories.  Fiction or non-fiction, studying a character and the circumstances that shape their personality, perceptions, and actions is exciting to me.  I actually cry a little inside when I finish a book because it means I have nothing left to learn from that particular character.  I read the entire Twilight series in a week.[ref]If you ask me to my face, I'll tell you I read it to support a student I'm mentoring.  But really, I was just curious and actually enjoyed the story. Sue me.[/ref] I just finished all three books of The Hunger Games in about 4 days.  I'm halfway through A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) and the Left Behind series as well.</p>
<p>Nothing is as captivating as studying a person's - real or fictitious - story.</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>Most of my writing is done on the computer. I can't write by hand at a speed anywhere near keeping up with my thoughts, and can only barely type fast enough to keep up.  Unfortunately, sitting in front of a computer all day saps me of my will to do so again recreationally.</p>
<p>I've won awards for my poetry and I've written several short stories (a few published under pseudonyms).  I keep <a href="http://prosepainting.com">a writing blog</a>, but neglect it so much it pains me to even let you see it now.  I also have 4 unfinished novels sitting around my desk begging me to take a year off work and just <em>finish</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the writing I <em>do</em> get to publish is stream-of-consciousness and published online.  Like this post.  Sadly, I rarely even have time (or energy) to proofread.</p>
<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>I know. Who wouldn't want to spend all their time on vacation?  But I don't just camp in the summer.</p>
<p>Is it raining? Great, let's go!</p>
<p>Is it snowing? Great, let's go!</p>
<p>It will only be 15 degrees this weekend? Great, let's go!</p>
<p>There won't be any plumbing or running water? Great, let's go!</p>
<p>My love for camping is the primary reason I keep working with the Boy Scouts.  I love the <em>idea</em> of the program, but the parent organization frustrates me enough with their policy that, if I had a way to be outdoors as often and <em>still</em> work with kids, I would.</p>
<h3>Volunteering</h3>
<p>When I was unemployed[ref]I quit a job due to an ethical disagreement with my employer.  He was cheating his employees and lying to investors. I found out. I don't work there anymore.[/ref] I spent every possible day working with Habitat for Humanity.  Going to sleep with a sore back knowing that some family would have a clean, dry, affordable place to live as a result ... well ... there's no better feeling in the world.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I also work with the Boy Scouts.  I serve as an Assistant Scoutmaster for a troop of about 30 youth.  I supervise camping trips, teach merit badges, and even advised on Scout working on his Religious Emblem last year.</p>
<p>I also volunteer in the community.  I'm mentoring a middle schooler who wants to be a writer, and I used to serve on my church's finance and worship teams.[ref]I'm in the process of, <em>potentially</em>, moving to a different church.  So I stepped back at the end of my term rather than leave the post unfilled with a sudden exodus.[/ref]</p>
<h2>Where Does This Leave Me?</h2>
<p>I honestly don't know.  I can think of a hundred jobs that might satisfy one or more of these passions I have, but <em>none</em> that cover everything.  Even the jobs I've found that cover <em>some</em> of them won't quite work.  Remember how I mentioned I went to grad school?  Yeah.  Still need to pay that off.  So online teacher writing books from a cabin in the woods won't really work out.</p>
<p>Instead, I try to carve time out of my day - each day - to focus on each of my passions.  Sadly, as time wears on and I continue to become an "older, wiser, more experienced" version of myself, I begin to doubt when - if ever - I'll find that miracle "dream job" that makes me happy beyond measure.</p>
<p>Is it out there?  Hopefully.  I just don't quite know what <em>it</em> is ...</p>
