<p>Last week, I was out shopping with my mom. We were talking a lot about the economy, jobs, banking, and generally "serious" topics.  At one point in the conversation, she was about to say something really vital.  Really groundbreaking.  Really important.</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, I'm just disappointed that ... there's a pink gorilla ...</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, standing on the side of the road was, in fact, a very large pink gorilla.  He inadvertently derailed our entire conversation because, for the next <em>week</em>, neither of us could remember where she was going.  From that point on, all we could think about was the ridiculous mascot standing on the corner.</p>
<p>I once saw Seth Godin's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159184021X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mindshmarket-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=159184021X">Purple Cow</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2009/02/ir?t=mindshmarket-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=159184021X" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, at the book store.  It seemed like a novel idea at the time, do something remarkable - create a purple cow.  Something that stands out from its surroundings.  In marketing we too often try to do things the tried-and-true way they've worked in the past.  We build templates, derive formulas, and build models for our marketing messages.  Advertisements fit a pattern, and brand building becomes a stagnant process - yielding a dozen Starbucks with maybe one or two differences between them.</p>
<p>Then you see a pink gorilla on the corner and everything changes.</p>
<p>What have you done in your business that is the same as your competitor?  Have you followed a model to build your brand?  There's nothing wrong with using a guide as a starting point, but how strictly have you adhered to my (or anyone else's) rules on brand development?  How much more effective could you be if <em>you</em> were in the pink gorilla costume?</p>
