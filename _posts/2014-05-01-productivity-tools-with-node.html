<p>I've been a fan of Node since we were first introduced in 2011. Unfortunately, it's taken me a few years to come up with a compelling business use for Node.</p>
<h2>Why so long?</h2>
<p>When I first met Node, I was working at a .Net development shop. Node was still a Linux-only tool, so to use it on a Windows machine I needed to compile the binaries myself (at the time, using a very exotic development environment).</p>
<p>It worked, but was messy and made my co-workers nervous when I suggested using something they couldn't build on their own (or find reliable 3rd party support for) in production. I tabled Node for later and wondered if I'd ever be able to use server-side JavaScript in my projects.</p>
<p>Working with a WordPress shop gives me more flexibility to use open source (i.e. community "supported") software, so I've long hoped I could find some synergy between Node and WordPress. On the whole, though, I haven't; much of the interactions I've seen thus far are crude hacks or developers merely trying to find an excuse to use Node just so they can use Node.</p>
<p>I spoke with some Node developers at length this past weekend at a conference trying to find ways I can supplement my WordPress work with Node and, finally, came up with some workable project ideas.</p>
<h2>Using Node in development</h2>
<p>I already use Node in day-to-day development thanks to Grunt. My build system is scripted in JavaScript[ref]I originally scripted everything in Ruby, using Rake, but converted it to Grunt as few developers were willing to learn yet another language in order to support my projects.[/ref] and uses both Node and NPM to keep things up-to-date in the background.</p>
<p>But a build tool doesn't feel like "using" Node, so I've been searching for other ways. Today, a specific project came up that dove-tailed <em>perfectly</em> with Node.</p>
<p>I'm working on a project where I need to verify - in bulk - the "source" parameter of several messages on Twitter. This is easy enough to do thanks to Twitter's REST API, but the REST API itself isn't necessarily easy.</p>
<p>Every request needs to be signed (OAuth) and the data return contains a large chunk of data extraneous to my interest.  I wanted a simple way to grab the data, strip out just what I need, and dump it to a report. As it turns out, this is a perfect task for a Node application.</p>
<p>I built a simple JavaScript program - the entire thing is 10 lines of code - that takes care of my needs. It first makes a request to Twitter for the data (using the <a title="node-twitter" href="https://github.com/istrategylabs/node-twitter">node-twitter</a> library). Then it iterates through the results and parses out just the pieces I need (using vanilla JavaScript). Next it formats the raw JSON data to a less markup-like format to make a quick view easier (thanks to the <a title="prettyjson" href="https://github.com/rafeca/prettyjson">prettyjson</a> library). Finally, it writes the entire report to a text file for simple distribution (using native Node APIs).</p>
<p>It's not a websocket server, a dynamic blog engine, or anything fancy on the server-side. But it <em>is</em> a way to use Node on the client side to quickly parse what is otherwise a large body of data and rapidly distribute results to my team.</p>
<p>Whether it's build tools or simple tools like the one above, being able to run JavaScript on my machine <em>outside of the browser</em> means I can be far more productive than without it. How else might you use Node in your development cycle?</p>
