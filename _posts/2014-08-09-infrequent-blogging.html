excerpt: Which has more value, frequent blogging or infrequent publishing?

<p><a title="Jake Goldman" href="https://twitter.com/jakemgold">Jake Goldman</a> and I have a disagreement. I blog every day. He blogs ... every quarter?</p>
<p>When I started my daily blogging endeavor, he asked whether or not I could keep things up all year. I have no doubt in his confidence I could create a daily post. His question was more rooted in the <em>quality</em> of those daily posts.</p>
<p>Another friend of mine actually started keeping track of "quality versus fluff" in the early days. Thankfully he gave up after the first month - it was too much pressure for me to write things that avoided his definition of "fluff."</p>
<p>Some writers make daily blogging seem effortless. I have never known <a title="Chris Lema" href="http://chrislema.com/">Chris Lema</a> to produce a meaningless post, and he's been doing the daily thing far longer than I have. I also know he plans out his various series weeks - even months - in advance. I have trouble just planning a few <em>days</em> ahead.</p>
<p>Some people blog daily to gain the increased traffic that comes from a frequent, predictable publication schedule. In fact, one of the first changes I noticed on my site was the <a title="By The Numbers" href="http://eamann.com/writing/creating-body-content/">amount of traffic</a> it actually sees every day. Other people blog daily because they have messages they want to get out - series that are important to a target demographic - in easily consumable chunks.</p>
<p>Yet other people shy away from daily blogging because they don't necessarily have the <em>time</em> to devote to polishing content in the format they desire on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Jake is one of these people.</p>
<h2>Long-form Content</h2>
<p>When I read blogs, I enjoy long-form, well-illustrated content the most. 300-word articles are great for pulp reading, but long-form content is what really gets me to think.</p>
<p>The downside of long-form writing is that it takes a <em>long time</em> to write a <em>long post</em>. Well, it take a long time to write a <em>good</em> long post. When you're as busy as Jake,[ref]I've seen his schedule. It's insane. If you think you're busy, think again. Even when I book myself for 12-hour days during a crunch period, he's <em>still</em> busier than I am. The fact that Jake finds time to write at all is a miracle.[/ref] carving out time to draft a short post is a challenge. Finding time to outline, draft, and polish a longer article is nearly impossible unless writing makes up a large portion of your schedule.</p>
<p>The advantage of infrequently-published long-form writing, though, is that every article is seen as more important.</p>

<p>When Jake publishes something, I read it. Every word.</p>
<p>When Chris publishes something, I skim it.[ref]No offense to Chris, but the consequence of daily writing is that it gives readers something to read every day. If I don't have time one day, I'll put it off. This sometimes leads to a backlog of several days of Lema posts ... I'd love to read them all, but usually have time to only skim the key points and read one or two in-depth.[/ref]</p>
<p>There's a considerable trade-off if you want to focus on long-form writing but don't consider that writing to be your day job. Fortunately, that trade-off (the inability to publish frequently) is often added value for a discerning reader base who can expect your infrequently updated blog to be of a certain quality.</p>
<p>Why do you blog? Why do you keep the schedule you keep? Does your editorial calendar hurt or help your end goals?</p>
