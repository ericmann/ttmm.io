<p>Last summer, I took part in the first Boundless Summer Challenge. We had a new task to complete every day; the tasks ranged from the easy (meditating on a thought or idea) to the very challenging (talk to a friend and ask how you can be a better friend). I had a blast and, though I didn't win the iPad prize at the end of the challenge, I think I learned a lot.</p>
<p>This year, the Summer Challenge is again kicking off in July. Once again, we'll be given a task roughly each day, but focused specifically on relationships. This weekend's challenge requires us to write a Facebook note tagging the challenge page itself as well as any friends who might be interested.</p>
<p>I'll be keeping track of my progress through the challenge both here (on <a href="http://groundedchristianity.com">Grounded Christianity</a>) and with regular updates to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150703035720287">note on Facebook</a>. Feel free to check in either place, leave comments, or <a href="http://www.boundlessline.org/2011/07/boundless-summer-challenge-task-1.html">join the challenge yourself</a> if you feel up to playing along.</p>
