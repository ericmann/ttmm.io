excerpt: "In high school, I wrote a short, 4-stanza poem titled My Beloved that no
  one really understood at the time.  I was asked repeatedly who I'd written it for,
  and kept giving the cryptic answer, \"I don't know yet.\"\r\n\r\nFast forward a
  little over a decade and I finally met the women for whom this poem was meant: my
  wife.  "

<p>I used to write a lot of poetry.  About nature, about war, about hope and dreams, and yes about love.</p>
<p>In high school, I wrote a short, 4-stanza poem titled <em>My Beloved</em> that no one really understood at the time.  I was asked repeatedly who I'd written it for, and kept giving the cryptic answer, "I don't know yet."</p>
<p>Fast forward a little over a decade and I finally met the woman for whom this poem was meant: my wife.</p>
<p>Since it's Valentine's Day, I wanted to share a little bit of romance with you.  So here's a love letter, written more than 10 years before I met the woman to whom it was dedicated.[ref]If you can wrap your head around the causality of that, you deserve a medal![/ref]</p>
<p>Be kind to the poem below ... remember, a teenager wrote it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>My Beloved</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I look on you,<br />
I see your face;<br />
Your beautiful smile,<br />
Your twinkling eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I see your soul,<br />
A magnificent angel.<br />
I see a mind,<br />
So broad and so fine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I dream of you,<br />
I long for you.<br />
Your touch comforts,<br />
Your smile slays my demons.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I see you and smile,<br />
For I know I am safe<br />
As you welcome me into your arms.<br />
I pray this dream never ends.</p>
