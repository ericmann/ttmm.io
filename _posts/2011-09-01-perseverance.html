<p>Every now and then we all come across situations we feel are hopeless.  A project is due with too soon a deadline.  A work task is just beyond our realm of comfortable effort.  An important appointment is endlessly rescheduled.  Our finances never seem to balance income versus expenses.</p>
<p>It can be <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exasperate" target="_blank">exasperating </a>to keep going.</p>
<p>Yet we still endure.  We persevere.  We keep going despite our fears and reservations.</p>
<p>My old Scoutmaster used to call this "sticktoitiveness"[ref]I still swear that can't be a real word.[/ref]  He, and other leaders of my youth, reminded me frequently that a mark of good character was to keep going when you felt like you could go on no longer.  Even if you need to ask for help, sticking with a task is important.</p>
<p>So yesterday, I asked some of my Facebook friends what kept them going when they felt like giving up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bacon</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I don't have much of a choice. Either I go on, or those who are counting on me to go on are let down.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Life doesnt stop just because you want it to. The tides are still going to change. Its a good opportunity to clean the slate and change direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the responses from Twitter were even better:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Makes no sense.:(</p>&mdash; Christine Rondeau (@bluelimemedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/bluelimemedia/status/108920816216965121" data-datetime="2011-08-31T15:15:20+00:00">August 31, 2011</a>

<p>All of these reminded me of advice my dad gave me years ago: "Remember, it won't last forever. No matter how hard it gets, it will eventually be over."</p>
<p>Hard to remember when you're neck deep in a difficult situation, but if you <em>can</em> remember that it will eventually be in the past, and that you'll be better for having done it, continuing to go on makes all the difference.</p>
<p>And there might be bacon when you're finished.[ref]My only requirement for doing massive chunks of driving to and from Yosemite was that I got bacon ...[/ref]</p>
<p>Perseverance demands faith. Faith that whatever challenge you face will pass. Faith that you will never be given a challenge that's beyond impossible. And faith that, even in times of trouble, you are not alone.</p>
