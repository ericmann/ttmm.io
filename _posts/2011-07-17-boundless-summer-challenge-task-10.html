<blockquote>Think of a friend or family member who could use some encouragement, and make a plan to spend time with that person this weekend. What you do together is your choice; perhaps you’ll take a walk, get lunch or coffee, shoot hoops — you know your friend best. Just ensure you have the time and atmosphere that allows for a good conversation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It can be hard to "just be" with people sometimes.  I always want to fill the quiet with words, talking about the mundane, asking questions to which I already know the answer, <em>anything</em> to fill the silence.  At the same time, that kind of white noise creates distance between me and the people I am trying to be close to.  I once heard that "friendship exists when the silence between two people is comfortable," and I think that's very true.</p>
<p>What I learned through this exercise is that I talk too much.  Even when I'm trying to listen, I talk.  "Uh huh" and "sure" and "OK" are verbal cues that I'm listening, but when used to excess they disrupt the environment.  Filling pauses in a friend's conversation with "sure" is as annoying as when they fill their own pauses with "um."  It actually makes it harder to listen and, sadly, I'll get bored and feel like I need to contribute.</p>
<p>This changes the conversation and redirects the focus to <em>me</em> rather than <em>them</em>.  So yesterday, I made a concerted effort to not talk, but just sit and <em>be</em> with my chosen friend while he talked about his life, his challenges, and his worries.</p>
<p>It was difficult for me, but I could tell later in the day that he was feeling much better having had someone to spend time with.  And I learned a great deal about myself, how I relate to others, and the things I need to work on to better connect to and support my friends.</p>
