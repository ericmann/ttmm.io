excerpt: After watching a few sessions of WordSesh - particularly the podcasting roundtable
  - I've decided to take another stab at podcasting. This time around I want to cover
  a broad range of topics, and throw in some video.  I'm asking for the community's
  help getting this show off the ground, and I won't be able to get things started
  without your help!

<p>In 2013, I set a goal to create a podcast.  My first run was a bit of a flop - it <a title="Podcast" href="http://eamann.com/tag/podcast/">yielded 6 episodes</a> and went pretty much nowhere.</p>
<p>My first podcast was entirely a faith-based show, ran about 5-6 minutes, and was scheduled as a weekly recording.  My audience consisted mostly of church friends and old Facebook buddies, neither of which were very interactive.  The low quality of my recording environment (a guest room next to a busy bathroom) paired with a frustrating headset mic and slow PC meant each 5-minute show took over an hour to produce.</p>
<p>In short, my first attempt was unsustainable and short-lived.</p>
<h2>WordSesh</h2>
<p>A few community currents are convincing me to get back on the horse.  First off, <a title="WordSesh" href="http://wordsesh.org">this weekend's WordSesh</a> was amazing and inspiring.  A roundtable of podcasting greats really makes me want to give podcasting another shot.</p>
<p>Albeit with a slightly different format.</p>
<p>Instead of faith-only, I want to cover all of the topics covered by this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faith (it's hugely important to me)</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>Technology in general (yep, I talk about more than <em>just</em> WordPress)</li>
<li>Business and marketing (this blog started with marcomm strategy, and I'd like to get back to that)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I want to make this a 30-minute broadcast rather than a 5-minute afterthought.  I also plan to incorporate video (publishing on YouTube in addition to this site and an iTunes feed).</p>
<h2>WordCamp</h2>
<p>I love speaking at conferences.  In 2013, I actually set a goal to speak at 5 or more events - the <a title="Three Decades Down" href="http://eamann.com/journal/three-decades/">final tally</a> was 8 different events!  It's the <em>travelling</em> that makes speaking so difficult.  As a result, I try to be fairly choosy about when and where I speak to spread things around.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my imagination is far less choosy about <em>what</em> it wants me to speak about.  My Google Doc of session ideas is aflood with topic titles and briefs, and there's not enough time in the year for me to deliver all of these talks.  Luckily, <a title="Jen Mylo" href="http://jenmylo.com/">Jen Mylo</a> came up with a great solution to this exact problem:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/jenmylo/status/270913596014354432</p>
<p>I still want to speak at WordCamps, but I don't want to <em>wait</em> to present some of these topics.  A weekly, 30-minute video podcast will give me a perfect way to broadcast my thoughts to the world!</p>
<h2>IndieGoGo</h2>
<p>In 2012, I used IndieGoGo to crowdfund a mission trip to Haiti.  I thought I'd give the site another go to crowdfund this podcast!</p>
<p>I <a title="Things that Matter Most Podcast" href="http://igg.me/at/eam-podcast/x/389939">set up a campaign during WordSesh</a> and, as of the time of this writing, I'm already 40% funded!</p>
<p>I'm asking the community to fund this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to have buy-in from my friends and colleagues before doing anything. If you all think this is a dumb idea, then I don't want to waste anyone's time moving forward.</li>
<li>I want to do things right, which means I want a quality recording setup from the get-go.  I know, the first episode doesn't have to be perfect (and it won't be), but I have no intention to monetize this podcast beyond this initial crowdfunding request, so there's zero chance it will pay for ongoing production let alone initial setup.[ref]I don't sell advertisement for my blog and don't do affiliate links in my posts.  My content is - <strong>always</strong> - free, and I want the video podcast to reflect the same sentiment.  Even with the occasional thanks-for-the-tutorial donation, this blog has never even come close to breaking even; that's OK, because making money has never been the goal of this site. It won't be the goal of the podcast, either. If it ever <em>does</em> make money for whatever reason, that will be a welcome bonus but will never be the emphasis.[/ref]</li>
</ol>
<p>I think of this project as a goal for the new year.  I've scheduled the IndiGoGo campaign to expire on the 1st, so I won't be dragging this on forever.  At the same time, there's no rush.  If the ideas above excite you, please take some time to <a title="Things that Matter Most Podcast" href="http://igg.me/at/eam-podcast/x/389939">donate to the cause</a>.</p>
<p>If you think it's a good idea, but can't donate financially, please <a title="Things that Matter Most Podcast" href="http://igg.me/at/eam-podcast/x/389939">spread the word instead</a>.  I appreciate any form of help you can provide.</p>
<p>If you think it's an awful, terrible, no-good idea I want to hear from you, too.  Leave a comment below and voice your opinion.  Remember, I'm trying to do this <em>for</em> the community, but only if the community wants it.</p>
