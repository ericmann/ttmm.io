<p>If a <a title="Blue Ocean Strategy" href="http://eamann.com/biz/blue-ocean-strategy/">move into a new blue ocean </a>is impossible, consider setting yourself up as an island in your red ocean.  There are techniques you can use to establish yourself as the market leader and provide a level of insolation from attack.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Never be satisfied with your current products</strong> - Always fight for new product innovations and be willing to incorporate your competitions' successful ideas.  This establishes you as a thought leader in the industry and new entrants will look to your company for inspiration.</li>
<li><strong>Set standards</strong> - Offer your way of doing things as an industry standard.  VHS was the standard for video, MP3 for music, USB for computer peripherals.  Here are two examples: Sony never allowed other companies to use the technology for Beta tapes.  VHS quickly became the standard and noone uses Beta anymore, even though it has higher quality.  Hewlitt-Packard has the best technology for making inkjet printer heads, and it created the standard for ALL inkjet printers.  Now, HP sells its printer heads to other companies; even Canon, Epson, and Brother ink cartridges have HP-manufactured printer heads!</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just two techniques your company can use.  While they might sound simple enough, any undertaking can be difficult.  Make a wise evaluation of the competitive landscape before declaring it a red ocean, and look to your competition first to see if they have already begun taking these positions.</p>
