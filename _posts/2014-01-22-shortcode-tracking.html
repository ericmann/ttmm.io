excerpt: At the moment, there is no way to query posts in WordPress based on the condition
  of having or not having a shortcode.  Such an ability would be hugely useful to
  both themes and plugins - should we add it to core?

<p>Continuing on with my <a title="WordPress Core Proposal: SUDO" href="http://eamann.com/tech/sudo-in-wordpress/">previous</a> <a title="WordPress Core Proposal: Aribitrary File Upload" href="http://eamann.com/tech/aribitrary-file-upload/">goal</a>, I want to pitch another WordPress core idea - but this time one that would be best suited as a patch rather than a plugin.</p>
<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
<p>At the moment, there is no way to query posts in WordPress based on the condition of having or not having a shortcode.  There's no way to grab all posts with galleries.  All posts with embedded audio/video.  All posts with legacy shortcodes in need of an upgrade.</p>
<p>Well, you <em>can</em> create a new [cci]WP_Query[/cci] instance and pass part of the shortcode in as a search parameter.  You <em>can</em> create a custom SQL query to match against the content of posts.</p>
<p>Both of these solutions are hacks; non-performant hacks at that![ref]Querying against post content means matching against an unindexed, unbound, <a title="MySql Longtext Documentation" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/blob.html">longtext</a> field.  This is a heavy query, and running it during routine blog operations is a horrible, terrible, no-good, really bad idea.[/ref]</p>
<h2>Proposed Alternative</h2>
<p>I ran head-first into this issue last week when I needed to query the database for all posts containing a [cci]gallery[/cci] tag.  The solution turned out to be a hook on WordPress' save action that flags the post as having or not having a gallery in a hidden "flags" taxonomy.</p>
<p>My proposal - make this part of WordPress core.</p>
<p>Every shortcode tag would become a term in a "shortcode" taxonomy.  On save, posts will be automatically tagged with whatever shortcodes their content happens to contain.  Queries then become simple:</p>
<p><code lang="php">$galleries = new WP_Query(<br />
    array(<br />
        'post_type' => 'post',<br />
        'tax_query' => array(<br />
            array(<br />
                'taxonomy' => 'shortcode',<br />
                'field'    => 'slug',<br />
                'terms'    => array( 'gallery' ),<br />
                'operator' => 'IN',<br />
            ).<br />
        ),<br />
    )<br />
);</code></p>
<h2>Does it Make Sense for Core?</h2>
<p>The first argument against this change would be "this sounds like plugin material."  On one hand, I agree.  Building a flags taxonomy for your theme or plugin to keep track of shortcodes in use is, ultimately, a simple endeavor.  Actually, I've already <a href="https://gist.github.com/ericmann/e60ba7868d9ec16020c0" title="Shortcode Taxonomy Proof of Concept">written the code for it</a>.</p>
<p>The argument to have this functionality in core, however, is a simple one: Standardization.  By having this code in core by default, all shortcodes will be tracked whether they're in core, in a plugin, or in the theme.  Plugins and themes can then query against a standard taxonomy to find shortcodes in use.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's an argument for interoperability between shortcodes among plugin and theme developers.  Does this argument mean it makes sense for core?  I say yes. What do you think?</p>
