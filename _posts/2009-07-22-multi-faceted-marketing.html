<p>How many sides are there in your market?  Are you a B2C?  A B2B?  A B2B2C (OEM)?  Whoever and whatever you are, you need to keep in mind that there are at least two sides to your market, if not more.</p>
<p>When most people think "two-sided market" they think of a marketplace.  eBay is a great example - it's a company that caters to both buyers and sellers, different types of customers with different points of pain.  eBay has a selling proposition for each side of the market and thus far has done a fantastic job.  Unfortunately, most of us work under the assumption that the eBay model is the only two-sided market model.</p>
<p>But it's not.</p>
<p>All of Apple's products live in a two-sided market as well.  Take the iPhone for example #1.  Obviously, the primary customer is the consumer.  The average Joe who wants a really cool cell phone with lots of options.  That makes sense, but it's not the end of the story.  Apple isn't a cell phone carrier, so they had to sell their value proposition around before finally landing the sale with AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Example #2 would be Apple's line of (expensive) computers.  Once again, the primary customer is the consumer.  And once again, that's not the end of the story.  Apple is not a manufacturer.  In fact, you find a small note on their products that says, "Manufactured for Apple."  In addition to selling their goods to consumers, Apple must sell their <em>brand</em> to a manufacturer.  The end user has no idea who built their computer, but they know it's branded with the characteristic Apple logo.  In order to secure a quality vendor, Apple must offer a quality co-branding agreement in exchange.</p>
<p>Most of you are thinking, "but aren't you talking about vendors?  Isn't Apple the customer in this case?"</p>
<p>Yes and no.  In a post-Wal-Mart world, we've been trained to think that the purchaser has the power - particularly in a B2B situation.  In many cases this is true, but discounting the selective power of the seller is a fatal mistake.  In a B2B world, the seller <em>can and will</em> refuse service to other businesses.  They don't <em>need</em> the sale - there will always be another opportunity.</p>
<p>In Apple's case, they are giving the consumer a computer in return for cash.  They are giving the manufacturer use of their brand and its related equity in return for a computer.  It makes Apple a pure marketing company - the middle man in an exchange between two sides of a market that never meet.</p>
<p>So if Apple, a self-proclaimed "consumer products company" is really living in a two-sided market, how many sides does your market have?</p>
