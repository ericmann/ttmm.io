excerpt: Until last weekend, my evening strolls have been in the dark - often in the
  wind and the rain as well.  This past week, though, they've been in the waning sunlight
  of a just finished day with clear blue skies overhead and the laughter of families
  carrying from the park down the street.

<p>The elementary school I attended had rows of cherry trees along the front entrance.</p>
<p>Every spring, when they were in bloom, the teachers would declare it was "popcorn season" because the popcorn trees were in bloom.</p>
<p>More than once, our seasonal art project would involve a faux tree adorned with popcorn.  It was comical, but refreshing after long weeks of gray, drizzly, Oregon winter.</p>
<h2>Cherry Blossoms</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6145" alt="Cherry Blossoms" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/03/2014-03-13-19.04.32-e1394764108318-211x300.jpg" width="211" height="300" />This particular season is one of my favorites.  It's just getting warm enough to trek outside without a jacket, but not so warm that you bake in the sun after a stroll or a jog.</p>
<p>The flowers are <em>just</em> starting to come out, but spring is not yet in enough affect to trigger seasonal activities.</p>
<p>Also, school is still in session, so I don't have to share my hiking trails with hundreds of teenagers or over-sugared little children.</p>
<p>While I walk through my neighborhood, I have the freedom to stop and actually appreciate the beauty before me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life.<br />

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Taking Time</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I try to take a walk every evening when I'm done with work.  After sitting for 8+ hours, staring at a computer the exercise is refreshing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But it's much more than physical activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until last weekend, my evening strolls have been in the dark - often in the wind and the rain as well.  This past week, though, they've been in the waning sunlight of a just finished day with clear blue skies overhead and the laughter of families carrying from the park down the street.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Taking time to breathe in the world doesn't just refresh me physically, it helps me refresh emotionally and spiritually as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Reflecting on the beauty of the sun-filled sky, the songs of birds in the trees, the joyful noise of children playing baseball, even the simple elegance of a just-bloomed cherry blossom in therapeutic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It helps me connect with the other wonders of creation around me, and makes me even more grateful for an amazing creator at the same time.</p>
