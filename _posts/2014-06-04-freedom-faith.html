excerpt: One of the things I value most is freedom; the freedom to make a decision
  and the freedom to make the wrong decision.

<p>There is nothing more in life that I value than freedom.</p>
<p>I have the freedom to make my own choices. I have the freedom to shape my own opinions and beliefs. I have the freedom to voice those opinions to others. I value these freedoms, and often find myself taking them for granted.</p>
<p>One of these freedoms most at risk for being taken for granted is the freedom to be <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<h2>Freedom to Choose</h2>
<p>I will never force my beliefs on anyone.</p>
<p>I follow Christ by choice. I choose to believe certain things about Jesus, the universe, and the way we're all meant to live our lives. I choose to live my life according to a certain set of values in the hopes that I will stand out as an example to others and, by that example, encourage open discussion of the God for whom I live.</p>
<p>But I will never legislate those values or otherwise force someone who doesn't believe as I do to follow my moral code. I live my life in a certain way because I have the freedom to do so - the fact that it's my <em>choice</em> is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>You have the freedom to ask me questions. You have the freedom to disagree with me and think my viewpoints are wrong. You have the freedom to live in a way contrary to how I believe we're created and meant to.</p>
<p>I will defend your freedom with every fiber of my being.</p>
<p>If I don't stand for your freedom to disagree with me, then my disagreeing with you is pointless and we're both damned.</p>
<h2>Freedom to Think</h2>
<p>My entire life I've had trouble <a title="Reconciling Faith and Science" href="http://eamann.com/faith/reconciling-faith-science/">taking much on faith</a>. For me, accepting anything without a full explanation is a <em>choice</em>, and I try to make it an informed one.</p>
<p>I challenge and question my faith daily. I read daily and surround myself with intelligent people with whom I disagree so they can further challenge me - and hopefully so I can challenge them as well.</p>
<p>I don't believe my faith is rooted in untruth or wrong thinking - otherwise I wouldn't believe it - but I do acknowledge that I could ultimately be wrong. I do, however, <em>choose</em> to believe what I believe and exercise my freedom to meditate on these beliefs to help strengthen and explain them.</p>
<p>I've come from a place of unbelief before and even if my faith today is misplaced, I know my head is in a much better space. Again, you're free to disagree with me, and I welcome your arguments.</p>
