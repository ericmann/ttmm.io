    more secure. Unfortunately, 1Password is also detrimental to online security as
    a whole.

<p>Ever since I was a victim of digital identity theft in college, I've kept a keen eye on data security.  I use long passwords that mix case, numbers, and punctuation.  I impose ridiculous must-change-passwords-every-6-months rules on myself.  And I never, ever write my passwords down for others to see.  But still, I feel like things could be more secure.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5502" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword/win"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5502" alt="1Password conveniently keeps multiple devices in-sync." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/02/header-home-e1361514733643-300x186.png" width="300" height="186" /></a> 1Password conveniently keeps multiple devices in-sync.[/caption]</p>
<p>As the number of online services I use continues to grow, the number of passwords I need to remember is quickly becoming unmanageable.  A few months ago, I actually found myself breaking a personal rule and reusing a password.  To help me keep from making this a habit, and out of a sincere concern for my security, a friend recommended I switch over to using <a title="1Password" href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> instead.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, 1Password is a fantastic little application that will:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Create arbitrarily strong, random passwords for you with one click</span></li>
<li>Store login information for as many sites as you use in an encrypted keychain</li>
<li>Sync data to the cloud via Dropbox so you can share logins between devices</li>
</ul>
<p>I purchased the full version after about a week of use and nearly all of my logins are now incredibly more secure than they were a few months ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they're now <em>so</em> secure that I can't even access things at times.  This has convinced me that, while 1Password is a huge step forward in password management, it's also a huge step back.<!--more--></p>
<h2>On the Road</h2>
<p>When I went on my <a title="Haiti 2012" href="http://eamann.com/faith/haiti-2012/">trip to Haiti</a>, I left my expensive smartphone at home and opted instead for a $20 disposable pay-as-you-go global handset.  It was great for quick calls and <a title="SMS Travel Blog" href="http://ericinhaiti.wordpress.com">SMS notes</a> to loved ones.  Towards the end of the trip, I discovered that the phone had a Facebook app built-in to the system.  I wanted to "friend" everyone from my team on the trip so we wouldn't lose touch when I got home.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my Facebook password is in 1Password, and I had no access to it without my Droid or laptop.</p>
<p>I figured I could just reset my Facebook password, change it to something simpler, and re-secure things when I got back home.  I hit the reset link and went to go check my email.</p>
<p>Only my email password was <em>also</em> in 1Password, so I had no access to Gmail from the road either.  No way to check my password reset messages or regain access to my other too-secure accounts.  I resorted to taking my friends' phone numbers and putting them in my disposable phone, promising to follow up when I got home and back to real technology.</p>
<p>When I did get home, the first thing I did was free my primary Gmail account from 1Password.  Imagine if my laptop and phone both became inoperable - I would have had <em>no</em> was to regain access to my accounts!</p>
<h2>Too-Helpful Security</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5501" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-5501" alt="iTunes requires you to re-enter your AppleID and password frequently." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/02/AppleID-300x175.png" width="300" height="175" /> iTunes requires you to re-enter your AppleID and password frequently.[/caption]</p>
<p>I might not be an Apple fanboy, but I still love my iPod for when I go running.  I subscribe to a handful of podcasts, and I usually download digital editions to iTunes when I buy DVDs.  iTunes itself is super concerned about security - so much that it makes me re-enter my password for just about every transaction.</p>
<p>This wasn't an issue until I switched from a 10-character pneumonic to 30-characters of gibberish.  Coping and pasting from the 1Password desktop app to iTunes is annoying, but not too difficult.  Doing things from within my iPod, though, is painful.</p>
<p>My process for purchasing music via my iPod is now:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Find song I want to purchase</span></li>
<li>Click to purchase</li>
<li>Unlock my Android phone</li>
<li>Unlock 1Password</li>
<li>Find my Apple ID</li>
<li>Enter the insanely long and difficult password one character at a time into my iPod</li>
</ol>
<h2>One Password to Rule them All</h2>
<p>The idea behind 1Password is pretty great.  Pare down the number of passwords you need to remember to 1, keep it secure, and use it to unlock a chain of arbitrarily strong passwords that you can use on every other service.  This makes my online identity much more secure and is a huge improvement over the old system of rote memorization I used to keeping things protected.</p>
<p>However, 1Password is (in many of my use cases, anyway) <em>too</em> secure.  My data is so well-protected that just about no one - including myself at times - can get in.  When data is so secure that the <em>owner</em> can't access it, there is no value to the security.  This too-rigid level of protection is actually a huge step backwards from my older system because I'm now trying to implement workarounds to keep my accounts unlocked so I can avoid tangling with 1Password's somewhat inconvenient entry systems.</p>
