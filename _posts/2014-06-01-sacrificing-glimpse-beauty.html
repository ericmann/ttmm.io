<p>"You're sure I can have the night off?"</p>
<p>"Yep. I'll cover you. Don't worry about it."</p>
<p>"Really, what's the deal. What'd I do?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Just relax and take the night off. I'll cover the hike tonight."</p>
<p>Pat seemed a bit confused, but was gracious for a reprieve from the weekly hike. Every Tuesday, he and Greg would lead a group of new scouts on a five-mile hike through some old growth forest around camp.</p>
<p>Five miles isn't that long of a hike. After dinner, with tired 11-year olds, though, it becomes a major burden, which is why Pat was assigned the task. Greg was the head commissioner at camp, so teaching first-year camper skills was his job.</p>
<p>Pat was one of the newest members of the camp staff, so doing things no one else wanted to do was <em>his</em> job.</p>
<p>I was one of the most senior directors at camp, so technically kicking back in the evening over coffee and stories from the day was my job. Just not tonight.</p>
<p>We left the dining hall after dinner around 6pm. Greg had 3 first-year scouts in tow, and I was excited for the hike to get started. We checked their hiking gear, making sure everyone had their outdoor 10 essentials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pocket Knife</li>
<li>First Aid Kit</li>
<li>Extra Clothing</li>
<li>Rain Gear</li>
<li>Flashlight</li>
<li>Trail Food</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Matches and Fire Starters</li>
<li>Sun Protection</li>
<li>Map and Compass</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd only be gone two hours - and almost shouting distance from camp - but making sure everyone was prepared was mission one. I normally hike with just a knife and fire starters, so I made sure to play the role of inspector/instructor rather than let any of the kids point out my relative lack of preparedness.</p>
<p>Everyone was ready, so we started off - at a good clip, too!</p>
<p>The boys were fresh off dinner and full of energy. They wanted to hike fast, but Greg and I held them back a bit. We both knew the hiking route took a turn up a steep hill within the first mile, so their boundless energy would soon be bounded.</p>
<p>Sure enough, two miles into the hike the first Scout complained about being too tired to continue and asked to turn around.</p>
<p>"We're already half-way through the hike. Whether you turn back now or keep walking, you'll <em>still</em> hike five miles."</p>
<p>"But I'm <em>tiiiired!</em>"</p>
<p>"Well, now you're <em>more</em> than half-way through the hike. Turning around will take longer, so let's keep going."</p>
<p>Mile four and I was finally at my destination. Not the completed hike, but a bend in the trail next to some white flagging tape.</p>
<p>The white flagging tape was placed by the Bureau of Land Management. They'd be clear-cutting the area to the right of the trail the following Monday. This meant we'd need to find a new hiking route for the boys next week.</p>
<p>It also meant the three wildflowers just off the trail under the large green fern would likely be trampled. I love wildflowers, and I'd given Pat the night off and hiked four miles with a set of whiney pre-teens <em>just to take a photo</em> of those flowers.</p>
<p>I bent down and snapped a quick picture.</p>
<p>"Got it," Greg asked.</p>
<p>"Got it. Let's go."</p>
<p>The boys were confused, but I didn't care. We finished the hike with a minimum of complaints and made it to our evening staff meeting only a few minutes late.</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised to see me walk in with Greg - they hadn't believed Pat when he told them I'd given him a night off.</p>
<p>"No really, I just wanted to take this photo. Come Monday, this entire area will be leveled and these flowers will be gone."</p>
<p>My friends unanimously declared me insane, but we kept going with the meeting. I, on the other hand, decided anyone who <em>wouldn't</em> sacrifice an evening of relative laziness to glimpse the waning beauty of a wildflower on the side of a trail was even crazier.</p>
