  That changes today.
---
<p>For years now, I've taken a very passive approach to syndicating site content. I pass my feeds through Feedburner and allow it to handle email subscriptions through RSS. Some time ago, I also added Jetpack's email subscriptions to the site (to supplement Jetpack comment subscriptions).</p>
<p>I've also built my own plugin that uses the Mandrill API to handle email subscriptions.</p>
<p>But none of these are really quality solutions because they don't really fit with the site.</p>
<h2>Syndication</h2>
<p>The point of syndication is to broadcast across multiple media, ideally reaching a larger total audience. In terms of TV, this happens when new episodes of a show are broadcast on one network, then re-runs are <em>syndicated</em> to another network that services a different demographic. The show itself receives a wider audience, and advertisers embedding their products, ads, and sales pitches have a proven vehicle for their delivery.</p>
<p>I already "broadcast" my publication through Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. It's a passive broadcast, but my audience on each network is aware of when new content goes live. But they can't consume my content on those networks - my broadcast is limited to a hook and a link, not full content.</p>
<p>I also "broadcast" my publication through RSS feeds, allowing readers to subscribe through their own software platforms or, through Feedburner, get an email every day when I push out new content. Unlike the social networks above, I push out the <em>full text</em> of each piece, but they're still delivered just one-way.[ref]Ironically, I often get more comments on my work from email subscribers than I ever do web readers. It's just that email responses become just-to-me comments that the world never sees. Not much in the way of community interaction there.[/ref]</p>
<p>Unlike TV syndication, I don't sell ads on my site. So what's the point of trying to increase my audience in the first place? Why am I wasting time writing about something that won't bring in revenue?</p>
<h2>End Game</h2>
<p>My overall objective has <em>always</em> been to monetize this site. Right now I'm working to <a href="https://eamann.com/writing/blogging-patrons/" title="Blogging Patrons">monetize through patrons</a> - feel free to follow the <a href="https://gratipay.com/EricMann/" title="Gratipay">Gratipay</a> widget you see on the right if you want to pitch in. Eventually, I plan to formalize this patron system, allowing sponsors to reap actual benefits from their contribution besides just the warm fuzzy feeling of helping keep this site online.</p>
<p>I also want to help this site evolve to be more than a "just me" effort - a shared publication featuring multiple voices, multiple opinions, and (hopefully) multiple articles each and every day. Part of this richer content set will also be a far richer email/RSS/syndication system.</p>
<p>But before I can solve the problem of interactivity, I need to answer the question of <em>frequency</em>. Articles will go live immediately on this site, but how often should they be pushed out through the various syndication channels available?</p>
<p>In short: if you subscribe via email, how often is reasonable (and in which format would you want) to receive updates from a blog?</p>
