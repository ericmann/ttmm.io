excerpt: All work and no play makes it hard to justify hobbies that look too much
  like your career.

<p>Once upon a time, working with computers was merely a hobby.</p>
<p>I was in graduate school, earning a masters degree in management and marketing. To better market <em>myself</em>, I purchased a domain name and started working on a website. The first version was vanilla PHP, but I quickly transitioned to using WordPress as a foundation and, once again, found myself with a blog.</p>
<p>Luckily, that hobby paid off in the form of freelance work when I couldn't find regular employment after school. It also helped me easily pivot from a marketing position to a tech one in a struggling startup.</p>
<p>I used to invest time heavily on my own schedule to learn new things. Version control was an evening project for me and eventually turned into a paid gig teaching other developers how to use Mercurial. JavaScript was a weekend project for me that eventually turned into paid full-time positions and somewhat routine acceptance at JS conferences.</p>
<p>That said, when a hobby becomes your career, it's hard to maintain it outside of work.</p>
<p>I spend 8+ hours every day sitting at a computer, writing code. There are hundreds of side projects I'd like to work on, but few ever see the light of day.</p>
<p>In September of 2013, I started working on an open-source Evernote clone. The project lasted about a month before I burned out and failed to ship even a buggy first version. Last December I announced too early that I'd have a Windows-based WordPress authoring app shipped by Christmas. I spent about two weeks working on the code, loving every minute, but finding little reason to keep going forward.</p>
<p>At the end of my days working with .Net code, coming home to hack on PHP was <em>fun</em>. It was the play to offset my work.</p>
<p>Now, my hobby has become my job and working on code outside of work has become something I <em>don't</em> look forward to rather than the thing that keeps me going. I've begun investing in other non-code hobbies, but it's very much like starting over from scratch.</p>
<p>In short: I'm looking for a way to make coding <em>on the side</em> excite me again in the way it used to. Otherwise my day job and my hobby time are both all work and I become a very very dull individual.</p>
<p>What do you do to take your mind off work and unwind at the end of the day/week/season?</p>
