<p>I was first introduced to <a title="Plupload" href="http://www.plupload.com/">Plupload</a> when I was building websites in .Net. &nbsp;I had some great HTML5 file upload tools that worked wonders in my browser of choice, but most of my colleagues (and about 80% of our clients) were using a browser that didn't support the API. &nbsp;I used Plupload as a reliable cross-browser tool that would use HTML5 where available and fall back on Silverlight for those users who hadn't yet upgraded to a&nbsp;<em>real</em> browser.</p>
<p>Cooler still, WordPress incorporated Plupload in to core! &nbsp;Now I could use the same tool for both my .Net projects and my open-source WordPress projects. &nbsp;I already knew the API forwards and backwards, so I was set.</p>
<p>Until the first time I tried to manipulate a Plupload event in WordPress.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Hacking Through The Brush</h2>
<p>Like many other good JavaScript projects, Plupload doesn't litter the global namespace with a lot of meaningless crud. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this means that unless you store a reference to your shiny new Uploader instance, you won't be able to talk to it again.</p>
<p>In the 3.4 days, WordPress built out <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/js/plupload/handlers.js" title="handlers.js">a bunch of handlers for the various Plupload events</a>. &nbsp;Then they buried the <tt>Uploader</tt> instance in a closure-scoped variable.</p>
<p>Inside an iFrame.</p>
<p>Needless to say, overriding or augmenting any of the stock upload events became somewhat impossible. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, I stated so in response to a <a title="Plupload Intergration in a meta-box?" href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/q/33173/46">WordPress Stack Exchange question</a> about manipulating these events just over a year ago.</p>
<h2>Finally, a Solution</h2>
<p>A project I'm working on right now is still using the 3.4-style media uploader.[ref]The reasons for this are beyond the scope of this post.[/ref] &nbsp;After implementing the uploader, my client made a request to lock down file types allowed in the upload to images only. &nbsp;Conveniently, Plupload gives us a <tt>FilesAdded</tt> event where we can hook in to scan the newly added file and either allow it or yell at the user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this event is assigned to the closure-scoped upLoader variable we referenced above. &nbsp;Furthermore, Plupload and its supporting scripts are being loaded inside an iFrame on the page, making it difficult to hook in at all.</p>
<p>Luckily, though, the FilesAdded event is merely a wrapper for a globally-scoped (in terms of the iFrame, anyway) <tt>fileQueued</tt> function. &nbsp;Using a few clever hacks, we can intercept this <tt>fileQueued</tt> function, replace it with one of our own, and keep chugging merrily along.</p>

        fileQueued = ifWindow.fileQueued;</p>
<p>        // Set new fileQueued handler<br />
        ifWindow.fileQueued = function( fileObj ) {<br />
            // If we're good, go for it!<br />

                fileQueued( fileObj );</p>

ImagePicker.prototype.isImage = function( src ) {<br />
    var ext = src.split( '.' ).pop();<br />
    ext = ext.toLowerCase();</p>
<p>    var extensions = [ 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif' ];</p>
<p>    for ( var i = 0; i < extensions.length; i++ ) {<br />
            var extension = extensions[i];</p>
<p>            if ( ext === extension ) {<br />

            }<br />
    }</p>
<p>    return false;<br />
};</p>
<p>var picker = new ImagePicker( 'Set Background Image', document.getElementById( 'image-picker' ) );<br />
</code></p>
<p>Without going in to too much detail, the object above sets up a new ThickBox image picker.  When you double-click the specified element on the page, an overlay will launch containing the media upload UI.  When you select an image, a custom change handler is called so you can do whatever you need to with the path of the newly-uploaded image.  To allow this custom handling, we have to store the original <tt>window.send_to_editor</tt> function somewhere, replace it with our own handler, then restore the original when closing the dialog.</p>
<p>Handling the <tt>FilesAdded</tt> event is similar. After the iFrame loads, we grab a reference to its internal <tt>window</tt> scope, grab the original <tt>fileQueued</tt> function so we can store it somewhere, replace it with our own handler, and restore it when the dialog closes.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>As one of my coworkers put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can't is a four-letter word.</p></blockquote>
<p>The task of hacking around a somewhat closed API seemed daunting at first.  Even now, the fact that it took me over a year to figure out this workaround is frustrating.  Luckily, the new media uploader introduced with WordPress 3.5 is a little easier to play with in terms of hooking events.  It actually <em>exports</em> the Plupload instance as part of the <tt>wp.Uploader</tt> object, so you can hook to events natively without such hacky workarounds.</p>
<p>Still, it's nice to know that, even in the absence of <a href="https://github.com/carldanley/WP-JS-Hooks" title="WP-JS-Hooks">advanced event management</a>, it's possible to hook in to WordPress when you need to manipulate stock behavior.  This flexibility is what continues to make WordPress a stellar platform for application development.</p>
