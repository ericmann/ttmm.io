  I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.

<p>One of my favorite TV shows was Discovery's <em><a title="Dirty Jobs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Jobs">Dirty Jobs</a></em>. I enjoyed seeing the variety of jobs out there that required hands-on labor and, often, constant exposure to the kinds of mess most of us would pay to avoid.</p>
<p>It was a good reminder that, however bad I thought a job might be, there was always a job out there that, to my mind at least, was worse.</p>
<p>But it was also inspirational.</p>
<h2>No Direction</h2>
<p>When I was getting ready to graduate from college (the first time), I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I'd just invested three years in earning a degree studying math and physics, but didn't know what I could use that degree for.</p>
<p>A handful of bad grades kept me out of grad school for physics. Teaching high school would require <em>more</em> education and at least a masters' certificate or emergency teaching endorsement. My summer job was still at a Scout camp. I had no real prospects for after graduation.[ref]The one job I'd managed to secure dried up before I finished school. An environmental research lab was opening in Vegas and offered me a position doing research on greenhouse gases. Unfortunately, the contractor building the facility ran off with their grant money, and they ended up abandoning the new project. I was left with nothing, and scrambling to find employment.[/ref]</p>
<p>At the last minute, a stroke of good luck brought me an offer of work through the Housing department. The only hitch, I had to remain a full-time student to qualify. I applied for a post-baccalaureate program and geared up to earn a <em>second</em> degree. But I <em>still</em> had no idea what I wanted to do for permanent employment post-college.</p>
<p>I spent much of the year studying hard and working to train my staff at the same time. On weekends, I started visiting construction sites. I liked the idea of <em>building</em> things with my hands, and wanted to see what I could learn through observation. I learned there was a lot of hard work involved and, without the experience necessary to be a general contractor or manager, not a whole lot of money.</p>
<p>Instead, I opted to remain a student and went straight to graduate school - less than 24-hours after my second bachelors' graduation.</p>
<h2>Digital Building</h2>
<p>As <a title="How I Started in Web Development" href="http://eamann.com/journal/started-web-development/">you've read before</a>, I fell backwards into a software position. I get to build new things <em>daily</em> and help people realize their dreams in reality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not <em>tangible</em>. Aside from licensing agreements, contracts, and honesty, there's not much preventing any Tom, Dick, or Harry from taking a product I've built and reproducing it a million times. Unlike artisan products (or buildings, or food, or printed works, or ...) the incremental cost of producing another piece of digital work is essentially nil.</p>
<p>So while I love what I do - making things and telling stories - there's not a lot I can do to enforce a premium on my work. It's not a <em>dirty job</em> that keeps others away because they want to keep their hand's clean. When push comes to shove, it's not a necessity people will pay for over other necessary expenses, either.</p>

<p>As <em>Dirty Jobs</em> came to a close, the show's host (<a title="Mike Rowe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rowe">Mike Rowe</a>, if you're living under a rock)  started transitioning to other events. He started a site geared towards skilled laborers and craftsmen. He began speaking at <a title="Maker Faire" href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a> about the importance of "makers" to our society.</p>
<p>None of this was any less inspiring than his show about the unsung heros driving our infrastructure. But it still made me feel a bit left out.</p>
<p>What I do is hard. It's taken me <em>years</em> to get to where I'm at. The work I do is often frustrating, and almost always in the background - websites work best when the engineering is unseen. But I don't work in the mud. I don't wield a blowtorch. I don't need hazard pay or special insurance when I'm working on a project.</p>
<p>I sit behind a desk. I work from home in an air-conditioned office. In comparison with other difficult jobs, there's nothing <em>dirty</em> in what I do.</p>
<p>Does that mean my work matters less? Does that mean I could do more to make my products and services valuable? Is there a way to better distinguish web development from "oh, my 11 year-old nephew does that too?"</p>
<p>The only constant from my childhood is that, when I grow up, I wanted to be a <em>maker</em>. Today, that's assumed to be a dirty or labor-intensive or highly-specialized job. Is that what I'm really doing?</p>
