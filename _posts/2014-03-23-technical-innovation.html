<p>I'm always on the lookout for cool new technology.  Sometimes, I find it in the most unexpected of places.</p>
<h2>Non-traditional Funding</h2>
<p>One of my favorite newer websites in <a title="Kickstarter" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to community efforts, artists and inventors can successfully fund their projects without seeking equity-draining venture capital or taking out a loan from the bank. By <em>crowd</em>funding, the community becomes an active participant in the future of the product or project.</p>
<p>It's fantastic! But it's also a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing funding source.  If you reach your financial target, you get paid and can proceed.  If you're short - even by just a few dollars - you don't get a dime.  I've seem a handful of projects come to within a thousand or a hundred dollars in the last hours of the campaign only to fall short and, subsequently, fail.</p>
<p>This is what brings <a title="Indiegogo" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo</a> (another crowdfunding website) even higher on my list.[ref]Indiegogo is also the platform through which I've pitched and funded some projects, including a <a title="Hear the Cry" href="http://eamann.com/faith/hear-the-cry/">mission trip to Haiti</a> and the new podcasting setup I use to product <a title="The Things that Matter Most" href="http://ttmm.io">The Things that Matter Most</a>.[/ref] Through what's called a "flexible funding campaign," you can attempt to raise your project's money and, even if you fall short of the goal, <em>still</em> collect what you've raised so you can bootstrap and move forward.</p>
<p>For some projects, the flexible nature of the campaign is what saves things.  It's also one of the major impetuses for using Indiegogo over Kickstarter.[ref]In the past, Kickstarter was also much more selective in <em>what</em> projects they allowed to appear on the site while Indiegogo allowed any submissions.  Kickstarter has recently relaxed their requirements, though, making this less of a concern.[/ref]</p>
<h2>Bootstrapped Innovation</h2>
<p>Crowdfunding is an incredible way to fund the development of new products and ideas that otherwise would never see the light of day. It serves as both a source of capital - freeing founders to focus solely on development rather than fundraising - and of community validation of otherwise difficult ideas.  When I find an idea I support, I'm quick to both comment to show support <em>and</em> to put up money to prove I'm serious.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received my "perk" from a recent backing on Indiegogo - a <a title="GravityLight" href="http://deciwatt.org/">GravityLight</a>.</p>
<p><a title="GravityLight" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gravitylight-lighting-for-developing-countries">GravityLight is a project</a> that aims to bring free, clean lighting to the 1.5 <em><strong>billion</strong></em> people in the world who otherwise turn to things like biomass (or kerosene) fuel when it gets dark.</p>
<p>http://vimeo.com/53588182</p>
<p>I first saw the GravityLight project shortly after returning home from my trip to Haiti.  I've seen first-hand the lack of efficient, reliable lighting in the developing world - the village I stayed in had 1 lightbulb, powered by a diesel generator.  The project really spoke to me, and I wanted to see it become a reality.</p>
<p>Thankfully, so did many others.</p>
<p>GravityLight asked the community for $55k to help make their dream a reality and begin shipping prototypes.  The community came through - to the tune of $399k!</p>
<p>The perk I selected - contributors are often repaid for their kindness with some form of bonus - is a GravityLight prototype of my own <em>plus</em> sending one to a family in the developing world.  I've received mine; I hope a family somewhere is receiving theirs very soon.</p>
<p>Technical innovation is becoming a rare thing in the world, which is what makes it all the more precious.  When I see such innovation, particularly when it supports a wonderful cause, I want to embrace and protect it.</p>
<p>Where do you see innovation happening? What's your first reaction when you see it?</p>
