excerpt: Abstractions build false confidence for new developers - so I'm going to
  show you how to build a post-to-post relationship system in WordPress from scratch.
---
<p>WordPress is well-known for its ability to extend to support custom content in the form of custom post types.</p>
<p>WordPress is also well-known for its <em>in</em>ability to build relationships between post types, custom or otherwise.</p>
<p>Savvy developers use tools like <a title="Posts to Posts" href="http://scribu.net/wordpress/posts-to-posts/">Posts 2 Posts</a> to overcome this limitation.  It's a powerful abstraction of an oft-needed one in the development world.  Unfortunately, it's an abstraction.</p>
<p>When you use abstractions too often, you neglect the underlying architecture and can run afoul of certain issues endemic to how things are build under the surface.</p>
<p>Abstractions build false confidence for new developers as well - so I'm going to show you how to build a post-to-post relationship system in WordPress from scratch.</p>
<h2>Shadow Taxonomies</h2>
<p>Essentially, you need to build a custom taxonomy that shadows your custom post type (or core post type) directly in a 1:1 fashion.</p>
<p>When new posts are added, new terms are added.</p>
<p>When posts are deleted, terms are deleted.</p>
<p>Then, rather than relating posts to other posts, you can tag a post with a term from the matching shadow taxonomy.</p>
<h3>First Step</h3>
<p>Assume you have a custom post type called "movie."[ref]Assume you're building a system to track Oscar nominees.  You might want to have both movies <em>and</em> actors since they can both be nominated.  But let's say you <em>also</em> want to relate authors to movies.  This system is designed for exactly that scenario.[/ref]  For simplicity, we'll create a taxonomy called "_movie."  The leading underscore doesn't mean anything significant, it's just how we're distinguishing one form of content from another.</p>
<p><code lang="php" height="410px">/**<br />
 * Register a taxonomy that shadows our Movie custom post type.<br />
 *<br />
 * This taxonomy will only be available for Actors.<br />
 *<br />
 * @uses register_taxonomy()<br />
 * @uses __()<br />
 */<br />
function register_shadow_taxonomy() {<br />
    register_taxonomy(<br />
        '_movie',<br />
        'actor',<br />
        array(<br />
            'label'         => __( 'Movie', 'textdomain' ),<br />
            'rewrite'       => false,<br />
            'show_in_menu'  => false,<br />
            'show_tagcloud' => false,<br />
            'hierarchical'  => false,<br />
        )<br />
    );<br />
}<br />
add_action( 'init', 'register_shadow_taxonomy' );</code></p>
<h3>Second Step</h3>
<p>When you update posts in the "movie" post type collection, you also want to create entries in the "_movie" taxonomy.</p>
<p><code lang="php" height="680px">/**<br />
 * When a movie CPT entry is saved, automatically create a entry in our pseudo-hidden "_movie" taxonomy.<br />
 *<br />
 * @uses get_post_type()<br />
 * @uses get_post()<br />
 * @uses get_term_by()<br />
 * @uses wp_insert_term()<br />
 *<br />
 * @const DOING_AUTOSAVE<br />
 *<br />
 * @param int $post_id<br />
 */<br />
function update_shadow_taxonomy( $post_id ) {<br />
    // If we're running an auto-save, don't create a term<br />
    if ( defined( 'DOING_AUTOSAVE' ) &amp;&amp; DOING_AUTOSAVE ) {<br />
        return;<br />
    }</p>
<pre><code>// If we're not working with a movie, don't create a term
if ( 'movie' !== get_post_type( $post_id ) ) {
    return;
}

// If we can't retrieve the movie, don't create a term
$movie = get_post( $post_id );
if ( null === $movie &amp;&amp; 'Auto Draft' !== $movie-&gt;post_title ) {
    return;
}

// If the movie already exists, don't create a term.
$term = get_term_by( 'name', $movie-&gt;post_title, '_movie' );
if ( false === $term ) {
    // Create the term
    wp_insert_term( $movie-&gt;post_title, '_movie' );
}
</code></pre>
<p>}<br />
add_action( 'save_post', 'update_shadow_taxonomy' );</code></p>
<h3>Third Step</h3>
<p>This one is optional - but you might just want to delete terms from the taxonomy as you delete posts from the collection.[ref]I say it's optional because, really, the missing post won't affect much.  But if you're deleting movies (due to editor error) and still present their relationships with actors, things might look a bit funny.[/ref]</p>
<p><code lang="php" height="680px">/**<br />
 * Remove a term from the shadow taxonomy upon post delete.<br />
 *<br />
 * @uses get_post_type()<br />
 * @uses get_post()<br />
 * @uses get_term_by()<br />
 * @uses wp_delete_term()<br />
 *<br />
 * @const DOING_AUTOSAVE<br />
 *<br />
 * @param int $post_id<br />
 */<br />
function delete_shadow_tax_term( $post_id ) {<br />
    // If we're running an auto-save, don't delete a term<br />
    if ( defined( 'DOING_AUTOSAVE' ) &amp;&amp; DOING_AUTOSAVE ) {<br />
        return;<br />
    }</p>
<pre><code>// If we're not working with a movie, don't delete a term
if ( 'movie' !== get_post_type( $post_id ) ) {
    return;
}

// If we can't retrieve the movie, don't delete a term
$movie = get_post( $post_id );
if ( null === $movie ) {
    return;
}

// If the movie already exists, don't delete anything.
$term = get_term_by( 'name', $movie-&gt;post_title, '_movie' );
if ( false !== $term ) {
    // Delete the term
    wp_delete_term( $term-&gt;term_id, '_movie' );
}
</code></pre>
<p>}<br />
add_action( 'before_delete_post', 'delete_shadow_tax_term' );</code></p>
<h2>Use in Production</h2>
<p>Now that you have a shadow taxonomy set up, you can use it to relate <em>any</em> other post objects in your installation to movies.  Extending the Oscar concept, this includes not just actors but also directors, producers, studios, and even reviews.</p>
<p>Post types are useful for storing large chunks of data in the WordPress database.  Taxonomies are great for storing - and efficiently querying - relationships between data.</p>
<p>Pairing them together means you have the best of both world: comprehensive data <em>and</em> efficient query-able relationships.</p>
