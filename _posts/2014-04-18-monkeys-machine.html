excerpt: Is JavaScript capable of powering more than just websites?
---
<p>JavaScript is the language of the Internet.</p>
<p>It's used to power dynamic interactions in front-end content.  It's used to power high-concurrency processing systems on the server-side.</p>
<p>But is JavaScript capable of powering more than just websites?</p>
<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>I've talked at length before about how JavaScript can be used to run high-performance (and even academic) programs.  I was able to convert an old Fortran <a title="JavaScript Astrophysics" href="http://eamann.com/tech/javascript-astrophysics/">astrophysics simulation into a JavaScript application</a> that runs in a fraction of the time, and with no exotic setup required.</p>
<p>Last fall I had the opportunity to <a title="jQuery Russia 2013" href="http://eamann.com/slides/jqcon-russia-2013/">speak in Russia</a> about the power of asynchronous data processing - using new APIs to power systems from graphics processing to encryption.</p>
<p><a href="http://eamann.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screenshot-2014-04-17-17.56.01.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-6264 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/04/Screenshot-2014-04-17-17.56.01-300x134.png" alt="Monkeys in the Machine" width="300" height="134" /></a>Next weekend, I will be <a title="JSConf Brazil 2014" href="http://2014.jsconfbr.org/">speaking in Brazil</a> about using JavaScript to power asynchronous data processing tasks.  My code demonstration will use multi-threaded client-side JavaScript to solve the <a title="Infinite monkey theorem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">million monkeys problem</a>.[ref]I will write at length about the code and my approach after the conference.[/ref]</p>
<p>My point: not only is JavaScript <em>everywhere</em>, it can do nearly <em>anything</em>.</p>
<h2>The Internet of Things</h2>
<p>As more of our household devices become interconnected, there is an underlying drive to standardize the <em>ways</em> in which they're connected.  This standardization was part of the impetus for developing Node.JS for the server.</p>
<p>I recently read an article proposing the use of JavaScript as an embedded runtime for not-computing devices.</p>
<p>Imagine: a microwave with internals scripted in the same language that powers Facebook.</p>
<p>This is both a frightening and an exciting development with technology.  On the one hand, standardization - anyone will be able to script their coffee-maker, their refrigerator, or air conditioner using readily-available and understandable code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it means security issues that currently plague the Internet will <em>also</em> affect our non-computing devices as well.</p>
<p>I've termed my Brazil presentation on JavaScript <em>Monkeys in the Machine</em> due to the nature of the genetic simulation it performs. The prospect of JavaScript as an embedded runtime, however, suggests there will only be <em>more</em> monkeys in machines we never anticipated.</p>
