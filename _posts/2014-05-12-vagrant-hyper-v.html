<p>Not that long ago, I moved my development setup from one Windows machine to another.[ref]Don't worry, I still use my Mac on a regular basis as well. I value my ability to work across and between both systems, so while my Mac is my primary out-of-office machine, I use a Windows PC regularly in my home office.[/ref] Since I wanted the ability to easily develop for Windows Phone and WinRT, I made sure to set up Windows 8.1 Pro and its built-in Hyper-V provider.</p>
<p>This also meant I had to move my <a title="VVV" href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV">VVV</a> setup away from VirtualBox and on to Hyper-V. <a title="Hyper-VVV on Windows" href="http://eamann.com/tech/hyper-vvv-windows/">Doable</a>, but with a couple of issues.</p>
<h2>Directory Mapping</h2>
<p>The first issue I faced was with symlinks.</p>
<p>For several of my projects, I set up a unit test repository that includes the main project as a Git submodule. This test repo is entirely separate from WordPress, so I need to symlink the main project to either the [cci]/themes[/cci] or [cci]/plugins[/cci] directory to get things to work right.</p>
<p>In my old VirtualBox setup, this involved creating a symlink inside the virtual machine itself. The link showed as broken in Windows, but was traversed properly within the host. A minor inconvenience, but it worked.</p>
<p>Once I swapped to Hyper-V, though, the link was entirely broken.</p>
<p>The Hyper-V setup with Vagrant uses <a title="Samba" href="https://www.samba.org/">Samba (SMB)</a>, a protocol fairly similar to NFS, to mount and share host directories within the guest. <a title="Symlink attack" href="http://www.samba.org/samba/news/symlink_attack.html">For security reasons</a>, Samba explicitly disables symlinks. For a few days, I thought I was sunk.</p>
<p>Then I remembered <a title="Hard Links and Junctions" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365006(v=vs.85).aspx">how directory junctions work</a> in Windows and tried setting the link through the <em>host</em><em>'s </em>file system.</p>
<p>Voila! Success. Paths within the guest OS now appear as expected, and Linux has no idea it's following a phony link and everyone's happy.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Hosts File</h2>
<p>In a vanilla VVV setup, all of your new domains are mapped to a static IP address - hard coded into the Vagrantfile and pretty easy to remember. If you have <a title="Vagrant::Hostsupdater" href="https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater">Vagrant's Hostsupdater</a> plugin installed, then these domains (and the static IP they map to) are all automatically added to your system's [cci]hosts[/cci] file upon starting the machine.</p>
<p>Hyper-V, however, does things a bit differently.</p>
<p>While creating, the system will ask you which network adapter to use for the virtual machine (unlike VirtualBox, it doesn't create its own adapter). If you select your real adapter - the only way for the guest to access the network - then your virtual machine will be granted a <em>dynamic</em> IP address on your network.</p>
<p>The machine will work just fine. You can add entries to your hosts file just fine. But the Hostsupdater plugin will add a bunch of entries for the (now invalid) hard-coded IP address in the Vagrantfile.</p>
<p>Luckily, the plugin is written in Ruby (a language I know and love), so I was able to hack around a bit to get the plugin to work with Hyper-V's dynamic IP address. <a title="Allow Dynamic IP Addresses #41" href="https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater/pull/41">A pull request I submitted</a> last week makes my modifications available to everyone.</p>
<h2>VVV Works with Windows</h2>
<p>The WordPress community tends to come down pretty hard on developers using Windows. Too often the answer to "how do I set up X on Windows" is "go buy a Mac, then come ask again."</p>
<p>Hopefully my <a title="Vagrant and Windows" href="http://eamann.com/tech/vagrant-windows/">initial work with Windows, Vagrant, and VirtualBox</a> helps to solve some of these issues. If you'd rather work with Windows' native virtualization (Hyper-V), then this article and <a title="Hyper-VVV on Windows" href="http://eamann.com/tech/hyper-vvv-windows/">my previous walk-through</a> should help get you started.</p>
<p>Let's stop bickering over our toolkits and go build something awesome!</p>
