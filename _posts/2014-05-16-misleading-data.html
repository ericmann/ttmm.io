<p>I've worked with all sorts of people - those who love data mining and those who abhor it. Honestly, I find statistics intriguing and, while I won't determine what I write based on traffic[ref]Well, I <em>might</em> use traffic as an indicator, but I won't let it rule my editorial calendar.[/ref], I do find traffic stats exciting.</p>
<p>Google's real time visitor tracking is incredible. I can see exactly how many people interact with my content <em>as they interact with it</em>. WordPress stats are incredible because I can track overall site impressions from within the tool I use to produce content.</p>
<p><a href="http://eamann.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screenshot-2014-05-15-22.50.41.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6346" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screenshot-2014-05-15-22.50.41.png" alt="Site Traffic" width="938" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I wrote (what I thought) was <a title="Playing the Field" href="http://eamann.com/tech/playing-field/">a great article</a> about seoslides. Imagine my surprise when I saw my traffic <em>almost triple</em> before the end of the day!</p>
<h2>Know your numbers</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, these statistics were a bit deceiving. It turns out, the WordPress stats widget displays overall <em>views</em>, not overall <em>visitors</em>. During Thursday's hackathon at the 10up summit, a few of my coworkers decided to use my live site as a testbed for some new code.</p>
<p>They're building a browser-based extension to a plugin I have on my site and wanted to test it against my site in real-time. I don't fault them for the traffic; I just got a little excited when I thought the Internet really loved my post.</p>
<p>As it turns out, my <em>real</em> visitor count was somewhere around 250 - about a <em>quarter</em> of the total views of the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://eamann.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screenshot-2014-05-15-22.52.29.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6347" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screenshot-2014-05-15-22.52.29.png" alt="Traffic Statistics" width="1890" height="506" /></a></p>
<p>Having a few developers site and click "refresh" several times throughout the day can really throw off your statistics.</p>
<h2>What do your analytics <em>really</em> say?</h2>
<p>I like to tell a story about a place I used to work. It was a startup struggling for new customers that had managed to recruit a total of 2 paying customers - consumers, not businesses.</p>
<p>By the time of our annual investor meeting, we'd increased this to 5 paying customers. The company CEO proceeded to stand in front of a room of investors and brag about our overwhelming product success: "we've increased our customer base by over 200%!"</p>
<p>He wasn't trying to mislead our investors - he was a numbers guy and, after putting all of our company information into Excel, ran a percentage to track our conversion rate. Nothing nefarious, just a failure to look deeper into what the raw percentage represented.</p>
<p>If you're not careful, it's easy to look at a single metric and, while excited, shift business objectives or strategies based on the result. Understanding what metrics you're tracking <em>and what they actually mean</em> is vital to preventing catastrophic business mistakes.</p>
