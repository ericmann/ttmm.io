<p>I had gone home from the weekend and, based on the stories of his antics circling when I returned, I <em>had</em> to introduce myself.  So I walked down the hall, knocked on the door, and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You don't know me, but I hear you're insane. Can I be your friend?</p></blockquote>
<p>Most <em>normal</em> people would have shut the door in my face.  Aaron invited me to dinner.</p>
<p>I considered Aaron my best friend in college - we lived together, we worked together, we played chess together.  Once he even talked me into impersonating a professor so we could vote against a motion in the University Senate.</p>
<p>Knowing that I never made enough time to spend with my friend after college tears me up inside - particularly knowing that now I'll never have that chance.</p>
<p>Aaron, you were the first friend I made after high school; I always considered you one of my closest. I'll always have incredible memories of our time together and the crazy things we did for fun. I always valued your insight, your unique way of challenging opinions, and above all, your friendship.  Our time together was short - far too short - but will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Rest in peace my friend, you will be missed.</p>
