<p>Yesterday, we were bouncing ideas back and forth on Twitter regarding a specific ticket on WordPress' Trac system.  At one point, a developer lamented the fact that Twitter didn't automatically link "#18149" to <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18149">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18149</a>.[ref]If you are talking about Trac tickets in any WordPress-related IRC channel, a bot will automatically fetch the ticket's title and URL for you.  It's quite handy.[/ref]</p>
<p>I jokingly commented that someone should come up with a Chrome extension to do just that.  Apparently, something that <em>does</em> that already exists.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/ericmann">ericmann</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/ipstenu">ipstenu</a> Does Chrome have keywords like Firefox does? I have one that's wptrac %s and then it punts me over to the ticket</p>&mdash; Helen Hou-Sandí (@helenhousandi) <a href="https://twitter.com/helenhousandi/status/116979340759146497" data-datetime="2011-09-22T20:57:02+00:00">Septembre 22, 2011</a>

<p>I've never used Firefox keywords, so I had to do a bit of Googling just to figure out what we were all talking about.  But apparently, Chrome supports custom search engines and shortcuts in the address bar.</p>
<p>You've probably noticed that sites you search the most end up being auto-loaded as search engines.  Whenever I type "amazon.com" I see a hint:</p>
<p><a href="http://ttmm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/tabtosearch.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3465" title="tabtosearch" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/09/tabtosearch.png" alt="" width="294" height="92" /></a></p>
<p>If you hit the tab key, the address bar will change to a search form and automatically perform your search on Amazon.com.  This is <strong>exactly</strong> the kind of functionality I wanted for Trac, and there's an easy way to add it!</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the address bar</li>
<li>Select "Edit Search Engines"</li>
<li>Set up a custom search enging</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I wanted to work with Trac, I set up a custom search engine that keys off the keyword "wptrac" and automatically searches for a Ticket specifically (rather than searching milestones, changesets, etc).</p>
<p><a href="http://ttmm.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/core-search.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3466" title="core-search" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/09/core-search.png" alt="" width="639" height="131" /></a></p>
<p>Now, whenever I type "wptrac" into the address bar, I'm prompted to "Press Tab to search WP Core Trac" and can automatically jump right to tickets.  Pretty nifty, huh?</p>
