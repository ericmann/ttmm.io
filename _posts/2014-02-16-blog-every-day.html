<p>Once upon a time I taught a writing seminar that focused on building several "pillar content" articles on a site.  The attendees were a diverse bunch: out-of-work marketers wanting to learn new tech, start up owners wanting to break into the market, students wanting to refine their creative voice ahead of graduation.</p>
<p>As diverse as the group was, they had one thing in common: a desire to tell stories.</p>
<p>Blogging is rooted in art: the art of writing.</p>
<h2>Writing Every Day</h2>
<p>Most of us write something every day of the week.  Aside from blog posts, you have emails, grocery lists, to-do lists, bill summaries, devotionals, etc.  Take some time to reflect on how often you actually <i>write</i> something, however inconsequential, throughout the day.  You might be surprised.</p>
<p>Writing something <em>consequential </em>every day is a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>You need inspiration.  You need a topic.  You need a thread of prose with which to weave.</p>
<p>Seasoned writers can whip up something spectacular every day with little to no preparation.  But this kind of talent isn't something inborn - it takes thousands of hours of practice to reach this stage.</p>
<p>As a new writer, you need to nurture discipline.  You need to schedule time to sit each and every day and <em>produce</em>.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be Pulitzer-worthy.  Just sit down and write something. Anything.  Everything that comes to mind, <em>every day</em> and you'll be closer to having the kind of mindset that will allow you to crank out publishable material every day.</p>
<h2>Blogging Every Day</h2>
<p>Anyone can publish a blog - that's the beauty of the open source movement that makes WordPress possible.  But not everyone can write <em>quality</em> work every day.</p>
<p>The cool thing: you don't have to!</p>
<p>I have been blogging daily since the beginning of the year.  I've also been writing daily - but not everything I <em>write</em> is <em>published</em>.</p>
<p>Instead, I often block out a few hours several times each week to comb through my various writings, determine which is the closest to being publication-worthy, and schedule articles in advance.</p>
<p>WordPress has the wonderful ability to schedule a post to be published in the future.  An awesome plugin, <a title="Editorial Calendar" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/editorial-calendar/">Editorial Calendar</a>, lets me keep track of when posts are going online so I can quickly fill up my schedule with new content.</p>
<p>I write every day. I also publish a blog every day - even if what I wrote that day wasn't publishable.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>
