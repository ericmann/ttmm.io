excerpt: WordPress' password creation/verification system is pluggable (meaning you
  can replace it with your own implementation). Before you do so, though, you should
  understand what's already implemented and why.

<p>With all of the talk of online security lately, a particular message in my inbox caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want know about WordPress' password encryption method; is it possible to change or replace it with another encryption method like MD5?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a heavy question, and rather than giving a simple yes/no answer, I want to supply a bit of detail regarding WordPress and passwords.</p>
<h2>Password Hashing</h2>
<p>WordPress doesn't ever store user passwords as plain text - I would highly suspect any that would.  This is the primary reason why, if you lose your password, you need to <em>reset</em> it rather than just have WordPress email your password to you.</p>
<p>Since WordPress doesn't store your password, even if your database is hacked, the attacker won't know what your original password was.  This is because the stored password is <em>hashed</em>.</p>
<p>When a password is supplied for authentication, the authentication will add a bit of "salt" to make the string much longer and more complex.  Then, it applies a cryptographic algorithm to the final string to create a one-way hash.</p>
<p>A specific plain text string will <em>always</em> generate the same hash. There is no way, however, to convert a given hash back to its plain text equivalent.</p>
<p>Different hashing algorithms have differing levels of security based on the relative sizes of the hash strings generated.  Some (like <a title="SHA-2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-2</a>) are widely accepted as being secure - meaning they haven't been successfully exploited (yet).</p>
<p>Others (like <a title="MD5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a>) have been broken for a while, are known to be insecure, and are generally frowned upon for use in securing applications.</p>
<h2>WordPress' Systems</h2>
<p>WordPress stores its cryptographic salts (strings used to lengthen plain text strings before hashing) in the global [cci]wp-config.php[/cci] file. These salts are unique for every installation and, if ever compromised, can be <a title="WordPress Salt Generator" href="https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/">readily re-generated</a> and replaced.</p>
<p>WordPress uses an open source library, the <a title="Portable PHP password hashing framework" href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">Portable PHP password hashing framework</a>, to generate hashed strings using several available algorithms.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, WordPress used MD5 to hash stored passwords.  As the application has grown, we've replaced that method with a system that supports mutli-level MD5 (more secure), DES, and even a more secure <a title="Blowfish" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)">Blowfish</a> algorithm.</p>
<p>To prevent breaking backwards compatibility, MD5-hashed passwords stored in the database are still valid.  When a user logs in with such a password, WordPress detects MD5 was used, rehashes the password using the more secure method, and stores the <em>new</em> hash in the database.</p>
<h2>Plugging Your Own</h2>
<p>If for some reason you absolutely <em>must</em> implement your own hashing algorithm, WordPress makes it pretty eash.</p>
<p>Both <a title="wp_hash_password" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_hash_password">[cci]wp_hash_password()[/cci]</a> and <a title="wp_check_password" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_check_password">[cci]wp_check_password[/cci]</a> are part of WordPress' pluggables file.  Simply define your own version of each function (i.e. in a plugin) and WordPress will use your version instead of the one that ships with core.</p>
<p>Just please <em>please <strong>please</strong></em><strong> </strong>do not replace these functions with a simple MD5 hash. MD5 is insecure (and many hackers likely have a rainbow table of potential passwords to use in an attack against your site already); WordPress moved away from it for a reason.</p>
