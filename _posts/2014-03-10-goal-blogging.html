<p>There are conflicting opinions as to what would prompt someone to keep a daily blog.</p>
<p>Personal fame and reputation seems to top the list - but I'm here to tell you that not everyone is in the writing game for personal gain.</p>
<h2>Writing to Write</h2>
<p>I tell stories.  Some of these stories are about personal adventures.  Some are about people I know or respect.  Some exist entirely within the realm of my imagination.</p>
<p>I write these stories down for little reason beyond getting them out of my head.</p>
<p>November is National Novel Writing Month and, though I've only "completed" on 50,000-word novel during the event, I still participate every year.  Writing is relaxing for me.  Few people will ever see those words, and that's perfectly fine.</p>
<p>There are times I write just for the sake of writing.</p>
<h2>Building a Larger Platform</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, I maintained a collaborative blog with two other writers - we focused on business analysis and projections.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating project.  One of our writers successfully predicted a handful of major economic events a full 6 months in advance based on current market indicators.  He used the body of content published on the site to launch his career.</p>
<p>Another writer used the platform as a launching pad for a career in sustainable (environmentally-conscious) business development.</p>
<p><em>Neither</em> would have gotten anywhere without the collaboriative platform.  Each writer's success helped build the prominence of a platform that, in turn, contributed to the success and audience of all the others.</p>
<h2>Why I'm Writing This Site</h2>
<p>As I've said once before, I'm not ready to reveal exactly why I'm maintaining this particular site.  But it is an objective that reaches beyond any sort of personal fame or popularity.</p>
<p>There are other reasons to write than personal exposure - why do <em>you</em> keep a blog?</p>
