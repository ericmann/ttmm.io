  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: Vagrant is a great tool for local web dev, so why not use
    it for jQuery too? I'm submitting a pull request to the jQuery team to add vagrant
    support.

excerpt: I use Vagrant for local development on WordPress.  It made perfect sense
  to use it for local jQuery development, too.  This weekend I put the finishing touches
  on a patch to add Vagrant support to the jQuery project - now you can leverage the
  power of this awesome tool as well!

<p>At <a title="10up" href="http://10up.com">10up</a> we've been using <a title="Vagrant" href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to power our local development environments <a title="Evolving WordPress Development with Vagrant" href="http://jeremyfelt.com/code/2013/03/17/evolving-wordpress-development-with-vagrant/">for quite some time</a>.  It's proven an indispensable tool when it comes to standardizing our environments and making projects more portable.  Also, it has the added benefit of keeping the local system free from resource-hogging applications like MAMP, XAMMP, Apache, MySql, etc.</p>
<p>Last week at <a title="jQuery Russia" href="http://jquery.itmozg.ru">jQuery Russia</a> I mentioned our work with Vagrant to some other devs.  I was bemoaning the requirement to run a local dev server (recommending WAMP or MAMAP or Mongoose) in order to run the jQuery unit tests.  I don't like cluttering my machine with long-running, heavy applications, so installing PHP or a bundled dev server <em>just</em> to run the unit tests felt like a waste.[ref]You could argue that Vagrant is itself a packaged dev server. It is. Except it's completely self-contained and you can turn it off with a single command line instruction. No registry keys, no background services. Clean. Simple.[/ref]  I told <a title="Scott Gonzalez" href="http://scottgonzalez.com/">Scott Gonzalez</a> with the jQuery team I was going to sit down and write a Vagrant wrapper for jQuery.</p>
<p>And so I did.</p>
<p>Today I'm <a title="Add Vagrant Support" href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1410">submitting a pull request</a> to the jQuery team to add Vagrant support to the project.  My patch adds a [cci]Vagrantfile[/cci] to the root of the jQuery environment and a single [cci]/vagrant[/cci] directory containing a provisioning script and the configuration files for PHP and Nginx.  When you run [cci]vagrant up[/cci] for the first time, your machine will download a virtual machine, install Nginx and PHP, and automatically configure [cci]http://jquery.dev[/cci] to point to your local jQuery development root.</p>
<p>You can easily spin up a virtual machine when you need to run unit tests, and turn it off just as quickly - freeing system resources and keeping your machine free of the cruft that collects around other local servers.  I'm hugely excited about <a title="Unit Testing: Minutes Now Will Save Hours Later" href="http://eamann.com/slides/unit-testing/">unit testing</a>, so being able to hack on and test jQuery as a go - without flooding my system with a bulky tool like MAMP - is a huge win.</p>
<p>Now that <a title="jQuery-Vagrant Fork" href="https://github.com/ericmann/jquery/tree/vagrant">this tool</a> is available, are you ready to switch over to Vagrant for your local dev needs?</p>
