        <div class="post-content">
            <p>As a kid, nothing captured my imagination more than space travel.  The idea of exploring new worlds was intoxication and I geeked out on everything spacey.</p>
<p>Star Trek. Star Wars. Stargate. Any story that hinged on some kind of hero, using some mode of interstellar travel to explore the universe.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this led me to a focus on science in high school.  I took advanced placement courses, then switched to a more-intensive <a title="International Baccalaureate" href="http://www.ibo.org/">international baccalaureate</a> program in physics.</p>
<p>I studied astrophysics, quantum mechanics, electrodynamics.  Anything I could find with a cool-sounding name attracted my attention and interest.  It wasn't long until I was enrolled in the <a title="Department of Physics" href="http://physics.uoregon.edu/">physics program at the University of Oregon</a>, double majoring in math to back up my studies in probability-based physics.</p>
<h2>A Fork in the Road</h2>
<p>My <em>original</em> plan was to work in the space program.  My high school science teacher talked often about her days at NASA, and I wanted to be involved on that level, too.  Sadly, the space program hasn't been active for ... most of my life, so I turned my interest instead to exciting the next generation of space aficionados.</p>
<p>I decided to be a teacher.</p>
<p>I practiced by tutoring my friends on everything from kinematics to chemistry.  It was fun, <a title="The Benefits of Public Speaking" href="http://eamann.com/biz/benefits-public-speaking/">I learned a lot</a> at the same time, and it seemed particularly applicable to my future goals as a teacher.</p>
<p>Except tutoring your <em>peers</em> doesn't count as teaching experience.  So I decided to pivot into <a title="JavaScript Astrophysics" href="http://eamann.com/tech/javascript-astrophysics/">experimental/theoretical physics</a> instead.  Eventually earning a doctorate would allow me to teach on the college level someday - my grades were good enough, and I was on track for a promising grad school appointment.</p>
<p>Until I argued with a professor.</p>
<p>Adamantly.</p>
<p>In public.</p>
<p>A series of retaliatory Ds on my transcript cost me my chance at a Ph.D.[ref]I was told at the time the only ways I could fix my transcript problem were to: ask the professor to change his mind (he kicked me out of his office when I asked) or to re-take the same courses from a different instructor.[/ref]</p>
<p>I had to change directions - fast.  As potential jobs dried up, I was left with one opportunity: tack an extra year on to my studies to work as an <a title="University of Oregon: Residence Life" href="http://housing.uoregon.edu/reshalls/">Assistant Complex Director in the Residence Halls</a>.</p>
<h2>A Fourth Year</h2>
<p>Graduating with a double major in just three years was a point of pride for me, so when I point out that I did go to college for four full years people scratch their heads.  The job I secured after I graduated the first time required I be a full-time student.</p>
<p>So I enrolled as a post-baccalaureate undergraduate and took a fourth year of college.  I also worked hard to determine if there were any major programs I could complete in a year.</p>
<p>Just one: political science.</p>
<p>I still helped tutor students in math, chemistry, and physics, but I was now spending my days studying politics.  Game theory, political economics, opinion polling.  The "science" in political science was very accurate, and I was lucky to pull over some of my knowledge of basic number theory into the social sciences classroom.</p>
<p>I also had to <em>write</em> a lot more often.</p>
<p>Part of cramming an entire academic major into one year means you have to take several (sometimes 5 at a time) 400/500-level classes concurrently.  These classes aren't designed to be done in parallel, so I was often writing a 4-5k word essay every night to stay on track with assignments.</p>
<p>The best thing about this program - it taught me how little I cared about the hard sciences behind my studies and how much I cared about the <em>stories</em> these sciences told.</p>
<p>I loved physics because of the <em>stories</em> it told about the physical world around us.  I loved math because of the <em>stories</em> it told how that physical world worked.  I loved political science because of the <em>stories</em> it told about the people who lived in that world.</p>
<h2>Finally, Graduate School</h2>
<p>I finished my second bachelor's degree in a year, and was able to leverage my higher GPA to get into a masters' program at Portland State.  I was so engrossed with the international components of my political science degree that I signed up for a <a title="Master of International Management" href="http://www.pdx.edu/gradbusiness/master-of-international-management">program in International Management</a>.</p>
<p>During the earliest days, we were encouraged to choose from three specialties: finance, supply chain management and logistics, and global marketing.  I'd already done my stint with numbers, logistics interests and bores me at the same time, but I <em>love</em> telling stories.  Global marketing was a no-brainer for me.</p>
<p>My year in graduate school consisted of more rigorous lectures,[ref]Our weekday lecture blocks were 4.5 hours long.  Saturdays were 8.5 hours of lecture.  After four years of 50-minute courses, taking notes for several <em>hours</em> at a time was agonizing.[/ref], an intensive language course, and a 3-week trip to Japan and China to meet with businesspeople on the ground.</p>
<p>Our professors consisted of experts from around the state - including executives from local multinational corporations and a couple of retired diplomats.  My exit project ("thesis") was a marketing study for a major sports manufacturer in the area trying to increase their share of the Japanese market.  I had the opportunity not only to interview their local management team but also spend time interviewing customers, partners, and regional managers in Tokyo before making a presentation.</p>
<p>I love marketing because of the <em>stories</em> it tells about products, the people who make them, and the people whose lives they impact.</p>
<h2>Another Pivot</h2>
<p>The consequence of cramming 3 separate degree programs into the same 4-year period: I finished school with my master's degree very young.  More than once, a job interview ended with, "I know I'm not allowed to ask this, but how old are you?"</p>
<p>Since the economy was on the decline, I had to compete with other professionals who had more years in the job market than I had on the planet.  One company even had the audacity to offer me $13k per year while requiring me to relocate to Manhattan, explaining, "MBAs are a dime a dozen, if you don't take it, someone else will, and I'll hire you a year from now for even less."</p>
<p>My prospects weren't too good, so I took the first job I could: with a tech startup.</p>
<p>A few months into the job, I had to shift from a focus on market research and corporate messaging (storytelling) to building and maintaining the company's website.  I knew very little about web development at the time: the majority of my code was copy-pasted from tutorials, manuals I found online, and examples from the <a title="YUI Library" href="http://yuilibrary.com/">YUI developer handboo</a>k.</p>
<p>When that job didn't pan out, though, I was able to use my work there as a portfolio piece to get me in the door with a new employer.  In turn, my work there led me to an even better job; one that <em>encouraged</em> giving back to the open source community.</p>
<p>Finally, my work in open source led me to <a title="Eric Mann joins 10up" href="http://10up.com/blog/eric-mann-joins-10up/">10up</a>, where I'm happily working on <a title="TechCrunch Has Redesigned, Again" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/15/techcrunch-has-redesigned-again/">some stellar projects</a> with an incredible team.  I get to work on open source <em>daily</em>, I have the continuing opportunity to teach and speak about my work, and best of all I get to keep telling stories.</p>
<h2>My Story</h2>
<p><a title="How I Started in Web Development" href="http://eamann.com/journal/started-web-development/">When people ask</a> how I got started in web development - or how I got to where I am now - I tell them.  I also tell them that I took a fairly non-standard route to make it to where I am today.</p>
<p>I'm not proud of every step I've taken, but I am proud of where those steps - even the misplaced ones - have led me.</p>
<p>I get to keep telling stories for my customers, and I get to keep writing my own as I go.</p>
<p>What does the path to <em>your</em> present look like?  What is <em>your</em> story?</p>
