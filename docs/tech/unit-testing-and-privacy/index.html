        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Over the Thanksgiving holiday, I had an interesting discussion with some of my Twitter peers about unit testing in WordPress:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/ryancduff/status/406239275194523648</p>
<p>If you know me, you know I like <a title="Start with a Unit Test" href="https://ttmm.io/tutorial/start-with-a-unit-test/">unit testing</a> - even when <a title="Making Singletons Safe in PHP" href="http://eamann.com/tech/making-singletons-safe-in-php/">singletons are involved</a>. &nbsp;Test-driven development makes life a whole lot easier for developers and QA teams alike, and I will&nbsp;<em>always</em> be a strong advocate of the practice as a standard in web development. &nbsp;That said, the question of whether or not to test certain parts of an application remains a good one on which there is no definitive answer.</p>
<h2>Not To Test</h2>
<p>The easiest stance to take is one I often advocate in unit testing overviews or quick tutorials: only test public APIs.</p>
<p>When you're building an extensible system, testing the API exposed to outside developers is a must. &nbsp;This suite of tests will help you, as the original developer, verify that the API behaves as expected and exposes the functionality your documentation[ref]You&nbsp;<em>are</em> documenting your API, aren't you?[/ref] claims it does.</p>
<p>As you further develop your application, you can re-run the tests as often as needed to verify functionality remains intact. &nbsp;This way you aren't breaking any promises your API design is making to the community.</p>
<p>If a method is declared as protected - or even private - it establishes the method as an internal behaviour and&nbsp;<em>should not</em> be subject to tests. &nbsp;Internal behavior - the inner workings and implementation of your system - should remain a black-box to anyone coding against your API. &nbsp;You can change it as often as you need, so long as the unit tests for your public API continue to pass.</p>
<p>In short - if it's public, test it. &nbsp;If it's private, it's magic and can be treated as such.</p>
<h2>To Test</h2>
<p>The alternative argument, which is one I'm beginning to embrace, is that&nbsp;<em>everything</em> should be tested. &nbsp;Yes, your code exposes an API to the world against which other developers can write code. &nbsp;The functionality of that API can and should be tested as completely as possible.</p>
<p>But unless you're a solo developer[ref]Few developers are truly solo acts anymore. &nbsp;Even if you're not a member of a larger corporation or entity, I can all but guarantee you will have someone else either contributing to or hacking on your code in the future.[/ref], there's a&nbsp;<em>second</em> API in your codebase. &nbsp;Every application, whether it exposes a public interface for developers or not, contains an internal API. &nbsp;This is the API you code against every day in your project, and it's just as important as - if not more than - your public API.</p>
<p>Once you invite another developer to work on your project, you're opening even private and protected methods within your objects to the team. &nbsp;A method for verifying nonces, for example, is something you would not likely ever expose via a public API. &nbsp;However, it contains certain functionality that&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;exhibit a specific, consistent behavior in order for your application to function properly.</p>
<p>In short - if it's critical to consistent functionality, even private functionality, test it. &nbsp;There is no such thing as magic.</p>
<h2>What is the Question?</h2>
<p>There is no generalization I or anyone else can make regarding what code should be tested. &nbsp;The best we can do is offer guidance to help determine&nbsp;<em>which</em> methods should be tested and which should be considered untestable.</p>
<p>Generally, all public functionality - the exposed API - should be tested. &nbsp;There might be pieces of functionality that dictate layout or element positioning; these pieces don't need unit tests but should instead be covered by integration tests.[ref]Integration testing can also be automated, but requires a slightly different toolset than unit testing. &nbsp;It's a bit beyond the scope of this article, but definitely something you should look into.[/ref]</p>
<p>Generally, private functionality&nbsp;<em>is</em> internal implementation and won't need to be tested. &nbsp;But if the private functionality is used in a utility context (i.e. it's used by your code and the code written by the guy in the next cubicle) then it absolutely needs to be tested.</p>
<p>I use the term "generally" above in both circumstances to try to explain a best practice. &nbsp;These are in no ways catch-all rules, however, and your best judgement is required when making the decision whether to or not to test a piece of code. &nbsp;I would always encourage erring on the side of testing. &nbsp;You can never have too many tests.</p>
<p>So let's say you decide there's some protected or private functionality in your class that needs testing. &nbsp;How exactly would you go about that?[ref]I work in the world of WordPress, and WordPress lives in the universe of PHP. &nbsp;All of the code to follow is PHP, but you can probably abstract the concepts to your language of choice.[/ref]</p>
<h3>Testing Protected Methods in PHP</h3>
<p>If methods are&nbsp;<em>protected</em>, one of the easiest ways to test them is to subclass your object and override them with a public method. &nbsp;This is the approach I use to unit test my PHP singleton pattern, and it works wonders.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/ericmann/7745729.js"></script></p>
<h3>Testing Private Methods in PHP</h3>
<p>Private methods are a bit trickier. &nbsp;Subclassing won't provide access since private methods aren't inherited by child classes. &nbsp;Instead, we can use a neat feature of PHP called&nbsp;<em><a title="Reflection" href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php">reflection</a></em>. &nbsp;Reflection will allow our objects to look at their own definitions and manipulate the privacy of their member functions, making things accessible to our tests.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/ericmann/7702180.js"></script></p>
<h2>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio</h2>
<p>Unit testing is a huge deal if you want to maintain clean, bug-free, future-proof code. &nbsp;It's a fantastic way to document your API to ensure functionality behaves as expected farther down the road when client requirements change and new code enters the project. &nbsp;It's&nbsp;<em>also</em> an effective way to ensure internal consistency between privileged APIs used by your development team.</p>
<p>There is no set of rules that can be universally applied to all code when determining whether or not to test. &nbsp;When you look at a function and ask, "should I test this?" the answer is&nbsp;<em>probably</em> yes, even if it's not part of your public API.</p>
