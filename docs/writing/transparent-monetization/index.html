        <div class="post-content">
            <p>I have never made a profit off my own writing.</p>
<p>That's not to say I've never made <em>money</em> off my writing.  In a past life I worked as a marketing consultant and wrote thousands of words - for pay - each week.  A lifetime after that I was a technical writer and, again, producing written work was my job.</p>
<p>Writing for a paycheck, however, is very different than writing for myself and making money off having my words read.  When I started blogging, I  hosted Google AdWords on this site.  It brought me a grand total of less than a dollar in over a year.</p>
<p>Today, though, I make approximately <em>nothing</em> on this site, and I'm trying to figure out ways to change that.</p>
<h2>Building a Platform</h2>
<p>I started blogging daily on this domain to build a platform.  To build a place where my voice - professional <em>and</em> creative - could reach the world.</p>
<p>Some would argue that I'm blogging to build my personal reputation.  Defending on how you define "platform," that may or may not be true.</p>
<p>The last time I built a platform, however, it was a collaborative effort between myself and 4 other writers.  Then, like now, I had monetization issues so eventually things failed - keeping a <em>team</em> focused on platform building is difficult when you ask them to do it for free.</p>
<p>What are my goals with building out this site as a platform?  Well, at the moment that's need to know.[ref]Sorry, but I'm playing this one close to the chest.[/ref]  What you should know, however, is that there <em>is</em> an objective behind this push for content creation and enhanced traffic - and it's not just my own personal gratification when viewing an analytics dashboard.</p>
<h2>Platform Monetization</h2>
<p>The trick to making such a platform a lasting thing, though, is being able to pay for it.</p>
<p>I can donate my own time for a while.  Eventually, however, there needs to be some form of pay out aside from just the good feeling I get from publishing my work.</p>
<p>Also, I need to pay to keep the servers running.  WordPress itself might be free, but the hardware that runs it and the bandwidth that connects it to the world certainly aren't.</p>
<p>This begs the question: how do I monetize this platform?</p>
<p>I already tried the ad route once.  It trickled in a few cents and, with the larger traffic flow I've gained, could prove more fruitful this time 'round.</p>
<p>Except for the tiny fact that <strong><em>I hate</em><em> advertising</em></strong> with the passion of a thousand burning suns.</p>
<p>A second option that's being exercised by many in the publishing world is the presence of a paywall.  Some content is always free, other articles are only available as an excerpt unless you pay to be a subscriber.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this model renders paywall-protected content unsharable.  My goal here is to build a platform upon which we can have an open conversation - locking part of the conversation down to a select few is in direct contradiction with the objective.</p>
<h2>One Option</h2>
<p>I personally subscribe to a handful of mailing lists.  Getting content - even drip content - from sites I enjoy in my inbox is a great alternative to either visiting the site manually or remembering to check out my feed reader.[ref]I've used Feedly since Google Reader died and, while I love it, I often forget to load it up for weeks at a time.  When I visit Feedly and have to sort through 1000+ unread blog posts, I usually take the easy way out and "mark all as read," missing some great nuggets of content in the process.[/ref]</p>
<p>I'm on the fence, but I'd like to experiment with premium email subscription.</p>
<p>All content would still be free and published on the site.  You would still be able to subscribe to updates of published posts completely for free.</p>
<p>But if you want a bit more, you could pay for an enhanced distribution - you would have the chance to receive posts in your inbox a few days (or weeks) before they're generally available.</p>
<p>Some more technical posts might contain additional supplements in the premium email version that aren't available elsewhere - like real code examples when I talk tech, or applicable case studies when discussing business ideas.</p>
<p>In addition, such an email subscription would likely contain guest content that ties in with posts on my site, even if the guest content is hosted elsewhere (I would leave out-of-email availability up to the original author).</p>
<p>Since it's an email, you'd be welcome - encouraged, actually - to forward and share the email with others.</p>
<p>I'm trying to keep monetization completely transparent here, so rather than go out and implement such a plan I want to ask for feedback first.</p>
<p>Is this something you'd pay for?  If it was offered as a monthly or annual subscription, how much would you pay for it?</p>
<p>Do you have any other suggestions for monetizing an otherwise free site that don't involve a paywall or selling ads?</p>
