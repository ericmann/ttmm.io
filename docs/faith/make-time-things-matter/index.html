            <p>Despite working on it for several years, I have yet to add that magical 25th hour to my day.</p>
<p>All the same, I have things on my to-do list, and several items fall by the wayside repeatedly.  When people look at <a title="Just Ship Already" href="http://eamann.com/tech/just-ship-already/">my half-finished projects</a>, <a title="Creative Writing" href="http://eamann.com/category/writing/">read unpolished stories</a>, or ask why I never started a million dollar company, I always cite my lack of <em>time</em>.</p>
<p>Well, that is until a good friend reminded me that was a cop-out:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/curtismchale/status/453752738040385536</p>
<p>The most damning part of this image is a single sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you want something bad enough, you make the time - regardless of your other obligations.</p></blockquote>
<p>That makes me wonder, do I really want these things <em>bad enough?</em></p>
<h2>Once Upon a Time</h2>
<p>After I earned my masters degree, I didn't want to start a company.  My sights were set fairly high - I wanted to work internationally in a management capacity controlling the marketing (product creation through advertising through fulfillment) for a sports-related company.</p>
<p>My youth led to several rejections. No one wanted to pay a 20-something with an MBA a real salary when they could hire someone instead with 20 years of experience to do the same job.  I was the risky option.  So I instead set my sights on building a company.</p>
<p>I started Jumping Duck Media so no one would be hiring "Eric Mann Enterprises" when I sold a marketing bid.  For the first year, it was pretty rough but passable.  I made a respectable income for a 1-man shop just starting out, and worked on contracts in along the West coast (Oregon, Washington, California) and with a client in China.</p>
<p>My failing at that stage of my career: time management.</p>
<p>I invested my time in ways that failed to pay off and held my time back from things that would have been revolutionary.  Also, I spread myself too thin and tried to juggle too many goals at once.</p>
<p>When one ball dropped, I'd get depressed and drop 3 others.  It was unsustainable, so I stopped working for myself and tried my hand at being an employee.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>In all of my jobs since I gave up being my own boss, I've had far more <em>time</em> than I expected.  I put in my hours - often more than I should - and can actually relax at home with a book.  Feeling free time makes me question what else I can do now that I'm not spending all hours of the night responding to RFPs.</p>
<p>I have time to write a daily blog.  I have time to record a <a title="Things That Matter Most" href="http://ttmm.io">weekly video podcast</a>.[ref]I know, I know, I missed last Friday. I will be making it up to you. I promise.[/ref] I have time to read <a title="GeekyLibrary" href="http://geekylibrary.com/">and review</a> books.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the things I <em>don't</em> have time for, I'm beginning to recognize <em>why</em> I use time as an excuse.</p>
<p>It was <a title="Nacin on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/nacin/status/452649497886461952">pointed out this week</a> that I spend more time talking about potential features for WordPress than I do writing patches.  True.  After a full (or more-than) workday writing PHP code, the <em>last</em> thing I want to do in my evening hours is keep writing PHP code.  Does this mean I won't?  No; it just means I haven't found a single idea I care enough about to invest my time there.</p>
<p>Despite having several partially finished stories sitting around my office, I've never polished one enough to publish.  Does this mean I won't?  No; it just means the ideas I've had thus far are interesting enough to <em>start</em> but too boring to actually finish.  If my story bores me, why would I subject anyone else to it?</p>
<p>Moving forward, I'm taking much more careful stock of my time.  This means I focus on one thing at a time, and if it's not something I care enough about to focus on, I drop it.  No more excuses; "time" has been a scapegoat long enough.</p>
<p>What have you <em>not</em> accomplished because you ran out of time?  What distractions could you give up so your time could be more focused on the things you actually care abut?</p>
