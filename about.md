Eric is a technical leader and software polyglot with over a decade of experience working on projects big and small. He has built high performance marketing websites for Fortune 500 enterprises, developed security applications for organizations like [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/), and [written extensively](https://www.phparch.com/books/security-principles-for-php-applications/) about best practices for software development.

Eric calls himself a ["Tekton"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekt%C5%8Dn) professionally. This is an ancient Greek word meaning artisan, craftsman, or builder that was used to describe the profession of Jesus Christ. This is an apt description of what Eric does and his identity.
